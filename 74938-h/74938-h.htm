<p class="ph3">INSULARITIES.</p>

<p>It is more or less the habit of every
country—more or less commendable in every
case—to exalt itself and its institutions
above every other country, and be vain-glorious.
Out of the partialities thus engendered
and maintained, there has arisen a great
deal of patriotism, and a great deal of
public spirit. On the other hand, it is of
paramount importance to every nation that
its boastfulness should not generate prejudice,
conventionality, and a cherishing of
unreasonable ways of acting and thinking,
which have nothing in them deserving of
respect, but are ridiculous or wrong.</p>

<p>We English people, owing in a great degree
to our insular position, and in a small
degree to the facility with which we have
permitted electioneering lords and gentlemen
to pretend to think for us, and to represent
our weaknesses to us as our strength,
have been in particular danger of contracting
habits which we will call for our present
purpose, Insularities. Our object in this
paper, is to string together a few examples.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe, generally,
people dress according to their personal convenience
and inclinations. In that capital
which is supposed to set the fashion in
affairs of dress, there is an especial independence
in this regard. If a man in Paris
has an idiosyncracy on the subject of any
article of attire between his hat and his
boots, he gratifies it without the least idea
that it can be anybody’s affair but his; nor
does anybody else make it his affair. If,
indeed, there be anything obviously convenient
or tasteful in the peculiarity, then it
soon ceases to be a peculiarity, and is adopted
by others. If not, it is let alone. In the
meantime, the commonest man in the streets
does not consider it at all essential to his
character as a true Frenchman, that he
should howl, stare, jeer, or otherwise make
himself offensive to the author of the innovation.
That word has ceased to be Old
Boguey to him since he ceased to be a serf,
and he leaves the particular sample of innovation
to come in or go out upon its
merits.</p>

<p>Our strong English prejudice against anything
of this kind that is new to the eye,
forms one of our decided insularities. It
is disappearing before the extended knowledge
of other countries consequent upon
steam and electricity, but it is not gone
yet. The hermetically-sealed, black, stiff,
chimney-pot, a foot and a half high, which
we call a hat, is generally admitted to be
neither convenient nor graceful; but, there
are very few middle-aged gentlemen within
two hours’ reach of the Royal Exchange,
who would bestow their daughters on wide-awakes,
however estimable the wearers.
Smith Payne and Smith, or Ransom and Co.,
would probably consider a run upon the
house not at all unlikely, in the event of
their clerks coming to business in caps, or
with such felt-fashions on their heads as
didn’t give them the head-ache, and as they
could wear comfortably and cheaply. During
the dirt and wet of at least half the year
in London, it would be a great comfort and
a great saving of expense to a large class
of persons, to wear the trousers gathered
up about the leg, as a Zouave does, with
a long gaiter below—to shift which, is to
shift the whole mud-incumbered part of
the dress, and to be dry, and clean directly.
To such clerks, and others with much
outdoor work to do, as could afford it,
Jack-boots, a much more costly article,
would, for similar reasons, be excellent wear.
But what would Griggs and Bodger say to
Jack-boots? They would say, “This sort of
thing, sir, is not the sort of thing the house
has been accustomed to, you will bring the
house into the Gazette, you must ravel out
four inches of trousers daily, sir, or you must
go.”</p>

<p>Some years ago, we, the writer, not being
in Griggs and Bodger’s, took the liberty of
buying a great-coat which we saw exposed
for sale in the Burlington Arcade, London,
and which appeared to be in our eyes the
most sensible great-coat we had ever seen.
Taking the further liberty to wear this great-coat
after we had bought it, we became a sort
of Spectre, eliciting the wonder and terror of
our fellow creatures as we flitted along the
streets. We accompanied the coat to Switzerland
for six months; and, although it was
perfectly new there, we found it was not regarded
as a portent of the least importance.
We accompanied it to Paris for another six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>months; and, although it was perfectly new
there too, nobody minded it. This coat so
intolerable to Britain, was nothing more nor
less than the loose wide-sleeved mantle,
easy to put on, easy to put off, and crushing
nothing beneath it, which everybody now
wears.</p>

<p>During hundreds of years, it was the custom
in England to wear beards. It became,
in course of time, one of our Insularities to
shave close. Whereas, in almost all the other
countries of Europe, more or less of moustache
and beard was habitually worn, it came to be
established in this speck of an island, as an
Insularity from which there was no appeal, that
an Englishman, whether he liked it or not, must
hew, hack, and rasp his chin and upper lip daily.
The inconvenience of this infallible test of
British respectability was so widely felt, that
fortunes were made by razors, razor-strops,
hones, pastes, shaving-soaps, emollients for the
soothing of the tortured skin, all sorts of contrivances
to lessen the misery of the shaving
process and diminish the amount of time it
occupied. This particular Insularity even
went some miles further on the broad highway
of Nonsense than other Insularities;
for it not only tabooed unshorn civilians, but
claimed for one particular and very limited
military class the sole right to dispense with
razors as to their upper lips. We ventured
to suggest in this journal that the prohibition
was ridiculous, and to show some reasons
why it was ridiculous. The Insularity having
no sense in it, has since been losing ground
every day.</p>

<p>One of our most remarkable Insularities is
a tendency to be firmly persuaded that what
is not English is not natural. In the Fine
Arts department of the French Exhibition,
recently closed, we repeatedly heard, even
from the more educated and reflective of our
countrymen, that certain pictures which appeared
to possess great merit—of which not
the lowest item was, that they possessed the
merit of a vigorous and bold Idea—were all
very well, but were “theatrical.” Conceiving
the difference between a dramatic picture
and a theatrical picture, to be, that in the
former case a story is strikingly told, without
apparent consciousness of a spectator, and
that in the latter case the groups are obtrusively
conscious of a spectator, and are
obviously dressed up, and doing (or not doing)
certain things with an eye to the spectator,
and not for the sake of the story; we sought
in vain for this defect. Taking further pains
then, to find out what was meant by the
term theatrical, we found that the actions
and gestures of the figures were not English.
That is to say,—the figures expressing themselves
in the vivacious manner natural in a
greater or less degree to the whole great continent
of Europe, were overcharged and out
of the truth, because they did not express
themselves in the manner of our little Island—which
is so very exceptional, that it always
places an Englishman at a disadvantage, out
of his own country, until his fine sterling
qualities shine through his external formality
and constraint. Surely nothing can be
more unreasonable, say, than that we should
require a Frenchman of the days of Robespierre,
to be taken out of his jail to the guillotine
with the calmness of Clapham or the
respectability of Richmond Hill, after a trial
at the Central Criminal Court in eighteen
hundred and fifty-six. And yet this exactly
illustrates the requirement of the particular
Insularity under consideration.</p>

<p>When shall we get rid of the Insularity of
being afraid to make the most of small resources,
and the best of scanty means of
enjoyment? In Paris (as in innumerable
other places and countries) a man who has
six square feet of yard, or six square feet of
housetop, adorns it in his own poor way, and
sits there in the fine weather because he likes
to do it, because he chooses to do it, because
he has got nothing better of his own, and has
never been laughed out of the enjoyment of
what he has got. Equally, he will sit at his
door, or in his balcony, or out on the pavement,
because it is cheerful and pleasant and
he likes to see the life of the city. For
the last seventy years his family have not
been tormenting their lives with continual
enquiries and speculations whether other
families, above and below, to the right and to
the left, over the way and round the corner,
would consider these recreations genteel, or
would do the like, or would not do the like.
That abominable old Tyrant, Madame Grundy,
has never been of his acquaintance. The result
is, that, with a very small income and in
a very dear city, he has more innocent pleasure
than fifty Englishmen of the same condition;
and is distinctly, in spite of our persuasion
to the contrary (another Insularity!)
a more domestic man than the Englishman,
in regard of his simple pleasures being, to a
much greater extent, divided with his wife
and children. It is a natural consequence of
their being easy and cheap, and profoundly
independent of Madame Grundy.</p>

<p>But, this Insularity rests, not to the credit
of England, on a more palpable foundation
than perhaps any other. The old school of
Tory writers did so pertinaciously labor to
cover all easily available recreations and
cheap reliefs from the monotony of common
life, with ridicule and contempt, that great
numbers of the English people got scared
into being dull, and are only now beginning
to recover their courage. The object of these
writers, when they had any object beyond an
insolent disparagement of the life-blood of
the nation, was to jeer the weaker members
of the middle class into making themselves a
poor fringe on the skirts of the class above
them, instead of occupying their own honest,
honorable, independent place. Unfortunately
they succeeded only too well, and to this
grievous source may be traced many of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>present political ills. In no country but
England have the only means and scenes of
relaxation within the reach of some million or
two of people been systematically lampooned
and derided. This disgraceful Insularity exists
no longer. Still, some weak traces of its contemptuous
spirit may occasionally be found,
even in very unlikely places. The accomplished
Mr. Macaulay, in the third volume
of his brilliant History, writes loftily about
“the thousands of clerks and milliners who
are now thrown into raptures by the sight of
Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond.” No such
responsible gentleman, in France or Germany,
writing history—writing anything—would
think it fine to sneer at any inoffensive and
useful class of his fellow subjects. If the
clerks and milliners—who pair off arm in
arm, by thousands, for Loch Katrine and
Loch Lomond, to celebrate the Early Closing
Movement, we presume—will only imagine
their presence poisoning those waters to the
majestic historian as he roves along the
banks, looking for Whig Members of Parliament
to sympathise with him in admiration
of the beauties of Nature, we think
they will be amply avenged in the absurdity
of the picture.</p>

<p>Not one of our Insularities is so astonishing
in the eyes of an intelligent foreigner, as
the Court Newsman. He is one of the absurd
little obstructions perpetually in the way of
our being understood abroad. The quiet greatness
and independence of the national character
seems so irreconcileable with its having
any satisfaction in the dull slipslop about the
slopes and the gardens, and about the Prince
Consort’s going a-hunting and coming back to
lunch, and about Mr. Gibbs and the ponies,
and about the Royal Highnesses on horseback
and the Royal infants taking carriage
exercise, and about the slopes and the gardens
again, and the Prince Consort again, and Mr.
Gibbs and the ponies again, and the Royal
Highnesses on horseback again, and the
Royal infants taking carriage exercise again,
and so on for every day in the week and
every week in the year, that in questions of
importance the English as a people, really
miss their just recognition. Similar small
beer is chronicled with the greatest care
about the nobility in their country-houses.
It is in vain to represent that the English
people don’t care about these insignificant
details, and don’t want them; that aggravates
the misunderstanding. If they don’t
want them, why do they have them? If
they feel the effect of them to be ridiculous,
why do they consent to be made ridiculous?
If they can’t help it, why, then the bewildered
foreigner submits that he was right at first,
and that it is not the English people that is
the power, but Lord Aberdeen, or Lord
Palmerston, or Lord Aldborough, or Lord
Knowswhom.</p>

<p>It is an Insularity well worth general consideration
and correction, that the English
people are wanting in self-respect. It would
be difficult to bear higher testimony to the
merits of the English aristocracy than they
themselves afford in not being very arrogant
or intolerant, with so large a public
always ready to abase themselves before
titles. On all occasions, public and private,
where the opportunity is afforded, this
readiness is to be observed. So long as it
obtains so widely, it is impossible that we
should be justly appreciated and comprehended,
by those who have the greatest part
in ruling us. And thus it happens that now
we are facetiously pooh-poohed by our Premier
in the English capital, and now the
accredited representatives of our arts and
sciences are disdainfully slighted by our
Ambassador in the French capital, and we
wonder to find ourselves in such curious
and disadvantageous comparison with the
people of other countries. Those people may,
through many causes, be less fortunate and
less free; but, they have more social self-respect:
and that self-respect must, through
all their changes, be deferred to, and will
assert itself. We apprehend that few persons
are disposed to contend that Rank does
not receive its due share of homage on
the continent of Europe; but, between the
homage it receives there, and the homage
it receives in our island, there is an immense
difference. Half-a-dozen dukes and lords, at
an English county ball, or public dinner, or
any tolerably miscellaneous gathering, are
painful and disagreeable company; not because
they have any disposition unduly to exalt
themselves, or are generally otherwise than
cultivated and polite gentlemen, but, because
too many of us are prone to twist ourselves
out of shape before them, into contortions of
servility and adulation. Elsewhere, Self-respect
usually steps in to prevent this; there
is much less toadying and tuft-hunting; and
the intercourse between the two orders is
infinitely more agreeable to both, and far
more edifying to both.</p>

<p>It is one of our Insularities, if we have a
royal or titled visitor among us, to use expressions
of slavish adulation in our public
addresses that have no response in the heart
of any breathing creature, and to encourage
the diffusion of details respecting such visitor’s
devout behaviour at church, courtly
behaviour in reception-rooms, decent behaviour
at dinner-tables, implying previous
acquaintance with the uses of knife, fork,
spoon, and wine-glass,—which would really
seem to denote that we had expected Orson.
These doubtful compliments are paid nowhere
else, and would not be paid by us if we had a
little more self-respect. Through our intercourse
with other nations, we cannot too soon
import some. And when we have left off
representing, fifty times a day, to the King of
Brentford and the Chief Tailor of Tooley
Street, that their smiles are necessary to our
existence, those two magnificent persons will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>begin to doubt whether they really are so,
and we shall have begun to get rid of another
Insularity.</p>


<p class="ph3">BEN SERRAQ.</p>

<p>The French-Algerian magistrate’s chaouch
or sheriff’s-officer, Djilali by name, was recovering
a little from the out-of-countenance
condition into which he had been thrown by
his failure in giving a miraculous turn to the
embezzlement of a couple of sacks of wheat
from the backs of a pair of donkeys: he
straightened his back, stood stiff on his
legs, and abruptly entered with ineffable
zeal on the discharge of his functions as
chief-constable and crier-of-the-court. He
felt himself in one of those happy moments
when, after having well deserved a
good beating, he was ready to transfer the
favour to the first person he met. He was an
eight-day clock wound up again, when just at
the point of running down and coming to a
stop. As he opened and shut the police-room
doors with the loudest bangings and clappings—shouting
for the plaintiffs to appear,
and hustling everybody who stood in his way
as he swaggered about the antechamber—the
assembly present, still impressed with the
sack-and-donkey scene they had witnessed,
whispered from mouth to mouth and from
ear to ear that, in the memory of mekrazeni,
so accomplished a chaouch had never been
seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a confused noise was heard out
of doors. As it approached, the sounds grew
louder; and at last the ear could distinguish
the most energetic oaths in the Arab
language, and the music which proceeds
from fisticuffs and kicks when applied to
divers parts of the human body. Djilali’s
voice rose above the tumult, and his stick accompanied
the melody of his voice. Finally,
the door opened, and a group of men, singularly
interlaced together, rolled into, rather
than entered the room. When Djilali, by a
succession of the most skilful movements,
had succeeded in putting a little restraint and
order into this tempestuous storm of arms
and legs, the eye could manage to distinguish
a group of five men, four of whom had quite
enough to do to enforce on the fifth a little
respect. The last-named worthy was of lofty
stature and vigorously limbed. His garments
torn to shreds, and his sorry face, attested
participation in a recent struggle; but his
hands, tied behind his back and fastened
by a rope to his neck, were evidence that he
had not been victorious. His companions
held him fast with a degree of caution which
showed that even in the state to which he
was reduced, they were not quite sure he
would not make his escape. Four ropes’-ends,
which dangled from his wrists and his neck,
were tightly grasped with exaggerated uneasiness
and tenacity. Scarcely had the five
new comers subsided into calmness, when an
unanimous exclamation arose from the midst
of the audience, “’Tis Ben Serraq! What
has he been doing now?”</p>

<p>M. Richard, the presiding magistrate,
inquired somewhat severely:</p>

<p>“What has the man done, that you
should bring him bound in that cruel way?”</p>

<p>“’Tis Ben Serraq!” was the answer he
received from the quartette of voices.</p>

<p>“Ah, Ben Serraq! A professional robber
belonging to the Sefhha, is he not?”</p>

<p>“The very same!” said the Coryphæus of
the associated plaintiffs.</p>

<p>“Yes, sure enough; ’tis I, Ben Serraq,”
growled the prisoner, in a voice which reminded
you of a wild beast roaring at night.</p>

<p>“But I was informed that he had amended
his mode of life, and that lately he has been
living at peace with his neighbours?”</p>

<p>“I have always lived at peace with my
neighbours. I am a good Mussulman, fearing
Allah and the law. I am calumniated.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue,” said the court, “and
do not speak till you are spoken to.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” explained plaintiff number
one, “that, for some time past, he has let us
be quiet, and only committed distant robberies;
but a few days since, he stole one of
our bullocks.”</p>

<p>“Sidi Bou Krari!” roared the savage.
“How dare they slander a poor innocent
creature like me in that way?”</p>

<p>“But is the fact clearly proved?” the president
inquired. “How did it occur?”</p>

<p>“It is as plain as can be,” stated plaintiff
number two. “There is not the least doubt
about the matter.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you get by serving the
French!” muttered Ben Serraq, with the air
of a Cato. “What ingratitude, gracious
Allah, Lord of the universe!”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Djilali received orders
to prevent the accused, by any means whatever,
from making lengthy interruptions to
the recital of the plaintiffs’ wrongs. As to
short exclamations that will break forth,
the chaouch might allow them to burst
from their safety-valve, seeing the material
impossibility of confining them within
the lips of a subject like the present defendant.</p>

<p>“Come, then,” said the court, decidedly,
“one of you explain the business.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind what they say,” Ben Serraq
roared out. “They are liars. Besides, they
have a spite against me.”</p>

<p>“As I said just now,” the complainant
stated, “the case is plain. Our herds were
grazing in the neighbourhood of Ben Serraq’s
tent. On driving them home in the evening
we discovered that a bullock was missing.
My brethren and myself immediately took
the field, to discover some trace of the robbery,
but we could discover nothing. At
last, after several days of fruitless search, it
entered into our heads to have a look at Ben
Serraq’s tent. We had suspected him, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>consequence of what had happened some
months previously.”</p>

<p>“Barbarians!” yelled the untamed innocent;
“to violate the tent of an honest
Mussulman!”</p>

<p>“But we had no need to enter it; which,
moreover, we should not have done without
the kaïd’s authorisation.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said the magistrate, approvingly.</p>

<p>“We met his wife, as she was coming from
the water.”</p>

<p>“What an abomination!” howled the biped
brute; “to stop a woman on the road!”</p>

<p>“And who, for the promise of a trifling
reward, told us the whole affair.”</p>

<p>“A capital witness!—a she-beggar, who
betrays me!”</p>

<p>“She explained that it was her husband
who stole our bullock, in order to provide
himself with a store of salt meat.”</p>

<p>“Sidi Bou Krari! That a woman should
lie like that!”</p>

<p>“She then showed us several goat-skins
filled with the meat.”</p>

<p>“As if a Mussulman were not allowed to
keep salted meat in his tent!”</p>

<p>“And, to remove all doubt as to where the
meat came from, she showed us the bullock’s
head lying in one corner of the tent, still in a
state sufficiently preserved to enable us to
recognise the animal.”</p>

<p>“What a horrible she-vagabond! But her
evidence is good for nothing; I had given
her a beating not two days before.”</p>

<p>“Our only thought then was to seize the
wild-boar who is now before you. There
was the difficulty; for this son of Satan is
as strong as no one else, and can knock down
a camel with a blow of his fist.”</p>

<p>“What a joke! I am as mild as a sheep.”</p>

<p>“Twenty of us met in company, and at
dawn of day, informed by his wife—”</p>

<p>“What a pity I did not strangle her, as I
meant to!”</p>

<p>“Informed by his wife that he was still
asleep, we rushed down upon him; and, after
a hard struggle, contrived to bind him in the
way you see, as he lay on his mat.”</p>

<p>“Sidi Abd-Allah! What treachery! To
attack a good Mussulman as he lay asleep!”</p>

<p>“And a good thing it was that we did attack
him in that way; for, although he was hardly
awake, he managed, while he was wrestling
with us, to break one of Oulid Sekrad’s legs,
and to put out one of Ali Oud Ama’s eyes.
He smashed in five or six of poor Bou
Senan’s teeth, and bit Otsman Oud Messassit’s
back savagely.”</p>

<p>“Justice of the Master of the World! is
it possible to lie in this way? On the contrary,
I have been half killed by you. Don’t
you see my face is covered with blood?”</p>

<p>“Son of a dog! you well know the blood is
from poor Oud Messassit’s body.”</p>

<p>“Sidi Abd-Allah!” exclaimed Ben Serraq.
But it was of no use invoking the saints.
Djilali called for a towel and a basin of
water, and with them washed Ben Serraq’s
face. The experiment established the fact
that that interesting individual had not received
the slightest scratch, and that the bite
on the unfortunate Oud Messassit’s back
must have been the only source of the
stains.</p>

<p>“Well, Ben Serraq,” said the president;
“although I cannot entertain any reasonable
doubt of your guilt, you are, nevertheless, at
liberty to speak—let us hear what you have
to say in justification.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I am allowed to explain! Well;
you will soon see! In the first place, my
wife is a she-vagabond—everybody knows it—don’t
they, Djilali?”</p>

<p>But Djilali, who was particularly anxious
to conceal all cognisance of the defendant’s
affairs, only replied,—“May your tent catch
fire! Pray, what connection have I ever had
with you, that I should know how your wife
employs herself?”</p>

<p>“Very well; ’tis of no consequence. But
the fact is notorious and incontestable—the
she-dog betrays my honour.”</p>

<p>“I will take your word for it,” said the
court; “and then?—”</p>

<p>“She has taken a fancy to Oud Raï,
whose people’s shepherds have treated me
so shamefully. I have often said to her,
‘Fatma, my darling, things cannot go on in
this manner; your improper conduct sets
everybody talking, and a modest and virtuous
man, like myself, will soon be the
laughing-stock of the whole country, and
that on your account. Mind what you are
about, else I shall be obliged to beat you;
and you are aware, my beloved, that, when I
do hit, I hit rather hard.’”</p>

<p>“But I do not see what reference your
matrimonial tribulations can have to the
business now before us.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—you will see directly.
I admonished her, therefore, with the utmost
gentleness, in accordance with my natural
disposition. But it was a waste of time and
breath. She persevered in her infamous
conduct till I was obliged, as a gentleman,
to administer to her and to Oud Raï one day,
a considerable number of kicks and thumps.”</p>

<p>“But, again I ask, what have these details
to do with the theft of which you stand
accused? Explain yourself, more clearly.”</p>

<p>“What! cannot a man of your great genius
see, now, how things have been managed?”</p>

<p>“I have an idea I can; but probably not
in the same light as you do.”</p>

<p>“What! don’t you see that Oud Raï and
my wretch of a wife, to be avenged of the
beating I gave them, have subtracted the
bullock in question without my knowledge,
and have cut it up in my tent, in order to
compromise me with the authorities? Sidi
Bou Krari! it is as clear as the sun, that.
Don’t you see that I am a virtuous husband
calumniated by a criminal wife?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>
<p>A subdued murmur, mingled with stifled
laughter arose in the assembly at the victim
air which Ben Serraq tried hard to assume,
and also at listening to the singular pleading
which he had improvised.</p>

<p>“Ben Serraq,” said the magistrate, in a
sceptical tone, “your case must be a very bad
one, to compel you to employ such poor
arguments for its defence. How could your
wife play you such a trick as you describe
without your knowledge, since your accusers
found your tent filled with the animal’s remains,
the head particularly being so conspicuous
and recognisable an object?”</p>

<p>“What is there extraordinary in that?”
asked Ben Serraq, not in the slightest degree
disconcerted. “My wife is so artful, and I
am so simple and innocent, that she could
easily contrive to conceal the matter.”</p>

<p>“Come; these are wretched arguments.
For a man like you, who has had so many
transactions with the authorities, it is not a
clever way of getting out of the scrape.”</p>

<p>“I invoke Allah and his justice!” screamed
Ben Serraq with the throat of a wild boar.
“I am a poor persecuted innocent; there is
nothing proved against me, absolutely nothing.
The case at least is doubtful,—that is incontestable,—and
in cases of doubt the law requires
me to take an oath. Put me on my
oath; I will swear on the Koran, on Sidi
Bou Krari, on whatever book you please, I
am as innocent as a suckling.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. You will take a hundred
oaths as readily as one. But, unfortunately
for you, I have not forgotten your previous
character, and must consider the charge
as completely established.”</p>

<p>“Allah! Lord of the Universe! Justice is
not to be had in this country.”</p>

<p>“Honest men will say the contrary, when
they hear you are caught, and especially
when they see you transported to France:
whither I intend requesting you to be sent.”</p>

<p>“That’s the reward people get for serving
the French!” swaggered Ben Serraq, as
Coriolanus might have done when banished
by ungrateful Rome.</p>

<p>“Not bad, by my faith! You doubtless
consider you are rendering people a service
by easing them of their purses.”</p>

<p>“I have been of service to you in time of
warfare, by marching constantly at the head
of your columns.”</p>

<p>“True; you have sometimes marched at
the head of our columns as a guide; but
most assuredly you insisted upon heavy
wages, as far as I can recollect. Besides, that
is no reason why you should be allowed, in
recompense, to plunder the whole human
race. You ought to have reformed, as you
promised you would, and then we should
have forgotten the past.”</p>

<p>“I am slandered! I am a victim!”</p>

<p>“Retain that idea for your consolation, and
hold your tongue. Djilali, take some of the
men on guard and lead this fellow to prison.”</p>

<p>“Sidi, Sidi!” pleaded Ben Serraq, “can
you not deliver me from these bonds, which
give me horrible pain?”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will. Djilali, unfasten the
ropes, which, in fact, are a little too tight. It
is impossible for him to make his escape now;
only, take some of the cavalry with you, and
keep a sharp eye on him on the way to
prison.”</p>

<p>“O, Sidi! such precautions are unnecessary.
I am as gentle as a lamb.” And
Ben Serraq made his exit escorted by a
numerous suite of mekrazenis, at the head of
whom was Djilali, and who, feeling the greatness
of his responsibility, marched as if he
were carrying the world. But an Arab chief
in alliance with the French, named Ben Safi,
whispered to the president as soon as the
prisoner had disappeared,</p>

<p>“Perhaps you were wrong to let his arms
be untied.”</p>

<p>“That is rather too good,” the magistrate
replied. “How, do you suppose, can he contrive
to escape from the custody of ten soldiers,
and in the midst of the town?”</p>

<p>“I have seen him escape,” Ben Safi explained,
“under circumstances that would
make one believe there was something diabolical
in his composition. One night, when
he had the impudence to come and rob in my
own smala, we contrived to seize him by
killing the horse he had stolen from us, and
under which it chanced that he was caught
as it fell. I had his hands tied behind his
back, and I ordered one of my men to kill
him like a dog, from behind, with a pistol-shot.
The shot was fired; but my gentleman,
instead of dropping down dead, as he
ought to have done, jumped up as lively as a
grasshopper, and disappeared as if a flash of
lightning had carried him off. The bullet
had only cut the cords which bound him, and
had been flattened on the palm of his hand.
We were stupefied with astonishment.”</p>

<p>“And well you might be!” said the official
head of the Arab bureau, beginning
to feel a little fidgety. “I now believe I
should have acted more prudently if I had
forbidden his being unpinioned till he was
safely lodged in prison.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you would;” interposed Ben
Tekrouide, a second friendly chief. “I have
always been told that this fellow is a perfect
demon, in human shape. At the market of
Kremis, he once robbed a man of his ass,
without his being aware of the theft, although
he was sitting on its back at the time.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the magistrate, in a fidget.
“I should be very glad to know that he was
definitely in custody under lock and key.”</p>

<p>“He has the strength of twenty men,”
observed Ben Maoudj, a third philo-Gallic
chieftain. “He once stole a camel laden with
wheat from a caravan proceeding to the
south; and, as the animal was unable to
travel over the rocky road by which he
wanted to pass, he took it on his back, wheat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>and all, and carried it in that way for half-a-night’s
march.”</p>

<p>“That must be a slight exaggeration,”
remarked the president, now feeling horribly
uncomfortable. “Nevertheless, I should
like to be quite sure that he had reached the
inside of the prison walls. They are very
long about it; they ought to be back by this
time.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish that I should go and
see?” asked Ben Safi, pitying his friend’s
uneasiness.</p>

<p>“I shall be much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>At the moment when Ben Safi was leaving
the court, a distant clamour was heard from
without, followed by several successive gunshots.
A sound of many footsteps was
audible, as if a crowd of men were approaching.
The doors were thrown open violently,
and Djilali made his appearance. His clothes
were torn and soiled with dirt, and his right
eye seemed to have suffered severely.</p>

<p>“Ouf!” he puffed out, “my back is
broken! May Sidi Abd-Allah burn me, if
he is a man.”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself. Tell me!” said the
court, on thorns. “Ben Serraq?—”</p>

<p>“Ben Serraq, indeed? If ever you contrive
to get him into prison, I will consent to
be roasted alive.”</p>

<p>“He has escaped, then?”</p>

<p>“How should it be otherwise: he is the
devil in person?”</p>

<p>“Have the goodness to tell me how you
could have been so stupid as to let a single
man break away from ten of you.”</p>

<p>“The thing was very simple, and he was
not long about it. When we got to the
prison, at the instant when they opened the
door, he unceremoniously seized the sentinel’s
gun; he twisted it round like the sails of a
windmill, and threw down three-fourths of
our number flat on our backs. I immediately
rushed upon him; together with the rest who
were still on their legs, and you see”—here
he exhibited his exterior, including his black
and swollen eye—“what I got by it. After
having nearly felled me by putting his
doubled fist into my eye, he seized me by
the skin, and threw me, like a bundle of
old clothes, on the top of my comrades.
We were all left rolling pell-mell together;
and, when I got up, I saw that demon
already landed on the other side of the river.
The guard came out and fired more than
thirty musket-shots at him while he was
climbing up the bank; but, bless me! they
might just as well have dusted his back with
pepper and salt. The bullets were flattened
without hurting him.”</p>

<p>“The thing is prodigious!”</p>

<p>“After he got to the other side of the river,
no one knows what became of him. Some
say that he burrowed into the ground,
whilst others declare that he took flight with
a couple of great black wings that suddenly
grew out of his sides and unfolded wide. The
soldiers belonging to the guard will have it
that he laid hold of a horse that was grazing
there, that he jumped on its back, and set off
at full gallop.”</p>


<p class="ph3">LANGTHWAITE.</p>

<p>Langthwaite was in a state of excitement;
its morals were perturbed, and its ideas confused;
its old landmarks were being swept
away, and it did not approve of its new landmarks.
Langthwaite notions were being assaulted,
and Langthwaite’s morality was put
to shame. Madame Floriani, the Italian widow,
had dared to defy the authority and disturb the
influence of Mr. Bentley, the young incumbent.
Was Langthwaite to be ruled over by a
strange woman who introduced foreign customs,
and upset the existing institutions,
or was its government to be a virtuous
hierarchy as before? Was the cousin of a
dean, or the widow of an Italian count, to be
considered the first personage of the vale?
This grave question was what Langthwaite
was called on to decide; and the quiet valley
in the heart of the mountains lashed itself into
a state of perturbation, strongly suggestive of
the famous tempest that was brewed in a
teapot.</p>

<p>The origin of the evil was this:—</p>

<p>When old Jacob White the miser, who
built Whitefield House of stone and marble,
and furnished it with painted deal and
calico—died, he left all his wealth to a certain
niece of his, his sister’s child, who had been
born and bred and married in Rome, and
who was now Count Floriani’s widow. She
was his only relative; and, although it went
sorely against him to leave his wealth to one
who was more than half a foreigner, yet family
pride at last conquered national prejudice,
and Madame la Comtessa Floriani was made
the heiress of Whitefield House and the lands
circumjacent. This good fortune brought that
Romanised young Englishwoman from the
blue skies and rich light of Italy, to a remote
village in the heart of the Cumberland
mountains.</p>

<p>The society of Langthwaite was peculiar,
and beyond measure dull. Dull, because
bigoted. The ideas of the denizens ran in the
narrowest of all narrow gauges, out of which
not a mind dared to move. The peculiarity
of Langthwaite was its power of condemnation.
Everything was wicked in its more
than puritanic eyes. Life was a huge snare;
the affections were temptations; amusements
were sins; pleasure was a crime;
novel-writers “had much to answer for,” and
novel-readers were next door to iniquity; an
actor was a being scarcely less reprehensible
than a murderer; and an artist was lost to
all moral sense—if, indeed, it ever chanced
that artists were spoken of at all, for the
Langthwaite intellect did not penetrate far
into the regions of art. No one “living in
the world” had a conscience, and no foreigners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>had the faintest notion of virtue. Langthwaite
was the centre of salvation, and outside
its sphere revolved desolation and ruin.</p>

<p>There was a national school at Langthwaite,
where all the ladies went on different
days and at different hours, to superintend,
some the work, and some the spelling; and
there was a Sunday school where everyone
fought for a class. It was the cordon bleu
of Langthwaite to have a class in the Sunday
school. There were a great many dissenting
chapels, and a great many missionary meetings.
Religious excitement being the principal
dissipation at Langthwaite, school feasts,
Dorcas meetings, district visitings, missionary
sermons, awakening preachings, and prayer
meetings, were infinite. The parish clergyman,
Mr. Bentley, said that the parish was
well-worked; and so it was. It was worked
until its mental condition was in such a state
of turmoil and unrest that no one knew
exactly what to believe.</p>

<p>To this society came Rosa Floriani, the
widow of an Italian artist-count, certainly, and
the semi-papistical latitudinarian, perhaps.
Why she came to Langthwaite seemed a
mystery to many. But it was in truth no
mystery:—she thought it was only right to
live among her tenants, and to do her best
to the society which gave her her fortune.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful woman, about
twenty-eight or thirty years of age, with
fine blue eyes, and light auburn hair,
as soft and shining as silk, braided in
two thick wavy masses of imprisoned curls.
She was very pale, as if she had lived much
in darkened rooms; but her lips were
red, and so were her nostrils. She was
about the middle size; one of those women
with small bones and soft outlines who
keep young and supple to the last. She
was negligent but coquettish in her dress;
with such taste in all her arrangements, that,
when she received her visitors in a white
muslin dressing-gown and small morning-cap,
clinging, like trellis-work against flowers, to
the curling hair, she seemed to be far better
dressed than the Miss Grandvilles in their
silks and satins, and jewellery and lace, and
grander than their grand carriage with a
footman six feet high. She was excessively
indolent in her habits; at least the Langthwaite
world said so; never, by any chance,
“dressed” at eleven or twelve o’clock, which
was the general time for paying morning
visits in that part of the world; and always
receiving her <i>monde</i>, as she called them, upstairs
in her dressing-room, in this kind of
pretty negligence—very often wearing
slippers, not shoes; little slippers of blue,
or rose, or brown satin, trimmed round
with lace and ribbon, clacking on the
ground as she walked, for they had no
heels. And indeed it was said that Madame
Floriani had been seen in the middle of the
day, and even in the evening, in the same
undress, which was very near to a crime in
Langthwaite. But her abode was worse
than her attire. She had fitted up Whitefield
House with all her Roman treasures,
and they scandalised Langthwaite. The
Miss Grandvilles said they were quite shocked,
and Mr. Bentley spoke through his nose,
and sighed as he called the pretty woman
“heathenish.” She had casts of many of
the best statuary set about her apartments—Saint
Catherine’s Marriage, the Madonna,
Saint Sebastian, the Judgment of Paris,
a Venus or two, and a few martyrdoms.
All this was like fire to stubble among
the people of Langthwaite. But Madame
Floriani, totally unconscious of the effect she
was producing, only thought the Langthwaitians
very cold in matters of art, and strangely
ignorant of real merit.</p>

<p>She was an artist herself; and sometimes
when they came in their grand, stiff, expensive,
and ungraceful toilettes, they found her
dressed in a man’s brown holland blouse, girded
with a broad leathern band: while a little blue
velvet cap, with a long tassel, was stuck
jauntily on the top of her graceful head, just
above those curly handfuls of bright auburn
hair. Whereat they were doubly shocked;
and the Miss Grandvilles, very tall, bony and
desiccated gladiators, said she was really very
unfeminine, and that it positively was not
proper.</p>

<p>Madame Floriani’s worst enemy was Mr.
Bentley. Mr. Bentley was the young incumbent
of Langthwaite. He was not more
than thirty as it was, and he looked like
twenty. He was a tall, round, boyish person,
with a round face, and round cheeks highly
coloured, an innocent little snub nose, with
those wide flat nostrils that make a greybeard
look a youth, light-grey eyes, narrow
shoulders, red hands—very red—with the
fingers always swollen, as if from chronic
chilblains, and a full, unformed mouth,
swollen, too, like a boy’s. But in spite of
this round face, with its ludicrous boyishness,
Mr. Bentley had taken up the condemnatory
and ascetic side. His sermons breathed more
than Judaic severity; hatred of pleasure,
hatred of art, hatred of liberation, hatred of
everything but extreme Calvinistic tenets,
church-going, and missionary meetings. This
was Mr. Bentley’s profession of faith as far
as he dare utter it even in Langthwaite.
Yet his solemn looks and severe words were
in such ludicrous contrast to that round,
red, apple-face of his, which nature intended
to express jollity, that more than
once Madame Floriani looked up and laughed,
saying, with her sweet voice and foreign
accent, “But, Monsieur l’Abbé, assuredly
you do not believe in yourself when you
speak so!”</p>

<p>Which words used to make Mr. Bentley
furious. As he said to the Miss Grandvilles,
his fast allies, it was very painful to see
Madame Floriani’s unconverted state of mind.
Thus the war between the pretty foreign
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>woman and the grave young clergyman went
on, and Langthwaite stood aghast.</p>

<p>Madame Floriani thought she must do
something for the place; so, after every one
had called, she began to give parties. Everyone
went to the first out of curiosity. Even
Mr. Bentley who disapproved of her so much
that he called nearly every day at Whitefield—to
try and convert her—even he went.
Though in general he was never seen at
any evening party, where the object was not
to sing hymns and hear a chapter expounded.
But he made an exception. Madame
Floriani had arranged her rooms very prettily.
She had brought in all the flowers from the
greenhouse, and placed them about the hall
and drawing-room. She had wreathed the
chandeliers with evergreens mixed in with
flowers; while large baskets of flowers, evergreens,
and moss, were placed on pedestals
all about, and brilliantly lighted. The rooms
were a flood of light, all excepting the little
room off the drawing-room, which old Jacob
White had called the study, and which
Madame Rosa said was her boudoir; and
this was dark. One candelabrum of two
wax-lights only, placed on a beautiful little
buhl table, reflected by two large mirrors set
in deep gold frames of grapes and vine leaves,
and falling on a marble statue of Ariadne,
set within a draperied recess—this was all the
light which Madame Floriani allowed in her
boudoir. Many objects of art were about;
there were models of the Coliseum and the
Tower of Pisa, of the Lion in the Rock of
Lucerne, of the Parthenon at Athens, and
there were busts of famous men—Dante, and
Petrarch, and Tasso—and pictures; a Magdalen
by Giorgione, a Venus by Correggio,
and views of Italy and Greece; and there
was a carved book-case full of splendidly
bound books, one was clasped with ivory and
one had precious stones upon the cover;
these, with curtains and draperies of rich
rose-coloured silk, made up the furniture of
Madame Rosa’s boudoir. A new style of
room in Langthwaite. They could not understand
it. The soft dim light, the living
beauty on the walls, the wealth, the art,
the management of effect, all perplexed
the worthy mountaineers, and went far to
convict Madame Floriani of some undesirable
characteristics. The Miss Grandvilles,
who led public opinion on matters of taste
and propriety, peered into it curiously, but
stepped back again immediately, as if it had
been a sorcerer’s cave; and by way of being
facetiously condemnatory, spoke to Madame
Floriani of the “great white woman in the
corner” as something they did not understand,
nor quite approve of.</p>

<p>The widow looked at them with the surprised
open-eyed look that had become
familiar to her since she came to Langthwaite,
and then with her silvery good-humoured
laugh cried out, “Why, my dear
mademoiselle, that is Ariadne!”</p>

<p>“I wonder how you can like those horrible
Greek stories!” said the eldest Miss Grandville
severely. “We who know so much
better things, to encourage those dreadful
superstitions and idolatries in any way—it is
shocking!”</p>


<p>“But, my dear demoiselle, you don’t think
that I believe in Ariadne as the Greeks did!”
said Madame Rosa. “It’s the art, not the
goddess one loves!”</p>

<p>“Art!” cried Miss Grandville, disdainfully,
“art! What is art, I should like to
know, but the worship of the creature. Art
is more nearly successful, Madame Floriani,
than I am afraid you think it is?”</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle! pity me, spare me!
I have been brought up among the great
things of art, and opened my eyes on the
Coliseum—I have lived where Michelangelo
worked—I have drank in love of art with my
first breath. I cannot forget its rich lessons
in this ascetic doctrine of yours. On the
contrary, I find in your beautiful country so
much to love and admire, that I wonder you
are so little gifted with the power of appreciating
and reproducing the beauty He has
created.”</p>

<p>This was a long speech for Madame Rosa,
and strangely free from foreign idioms. For
she was excited, and forgot to be careful.</p>

<p>“My dear Madame,” said Mrs. Bentley,
solemnly; “you speak of natural religion
only.”</p>

<p>“Come! come! we must not discuss
theology at a soirée,” she exclaimed, “that
would be a misuse of time indeed. Will you
waltz, Miss Grandville!” And before that
horrified lady could return an answer, the
pretty widow had glided across the room in
her peculiar manner of grace and lightness;
and, going to the piano, dashed
into a maddening waltz. Now, to begin
with, only two young ladies of the Langthwaite’s
society could waltz, and these
were the daughters of a retired Captain, who
had the good luck to own relatives in London.
But they were thought bold and light in
Langthwaite (although as good girls as ever
breathed), because they went to the opera and
the theatres when they were in town, and
confessed to the polka, and waltzing. They
were very pretty, lively, and good-natured;
and when Madame Rosa played her waltz,
they both stood up and said, that if others
would dance they would. There was no response.
Some said, “What bold girls those
Miss Winters are!” and others, “Oh! Laura
and Helen Winter will go the whole way
with any woman of the world! We can’t
expect anything from them.” And one old
maid, who had never had an offer, nor heard
a word of love in her life, bit the end off the
adjective “disgusting,” and flounced her
shawl—Shetland—tightly round her, as she
thanked Heaven, that she had never done
such a thing when she was young! And
then when Rosa turned round on her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>music-stool, with her hands in her lap,
and said, “Eh bien! who will dance?” Mr.
Bentley came up, “Excuse me, Madame
Floriani,” he said rather nervously, for
the widow looked so arch and lovely, that it
required all Langthwaite severity to resist
her. “You are a stranger to our customs,
and you do not understand us yet. I hope
that after you have been among us for a little
time we shall be good friends and be able to
work together. But we have banished all
these frivolities from Langthwaite. My flock,
I am happy to say, does not dance.”</p>

<p>“Not dance, Monsieur! and why?” cried
Rosa, with a burst of laughter, real southern
laughter, such as you never hear in polite
society in England now.</p>

<p>“I look on dancing, Madame Floriani, as
an invention of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“What enemy?—the Russians? Oh no,
I assure you, les Russes did not introduce
the dance. That is drôle; I did not know
you were such good patriots down here!”
And she laughed again.</p>

<p>“But Madame Floriani,” said Miss Grandville,
coming to the rescue; “we don’t ourselves
think dancing proper.”</p>

<p>“Not proper!” said Rosa, flushing to her
temples, “what monstrous ideas! What impropriety
can there be in a party of young
people amusing themselves with dancing or
anything else convenable?”</p>

<p>“It is a worldly amusement,” said Miss
Grandville stiffly.</p>

<p>“And a degradation of the immortal
nature,” said Mr. Bentley.</p>

<p>Madame Rosa looked from one to the other
as if they had been Aztecs or Red Indians, or
any other unusual specimens of humanity;
then, utterly unable to find any sort of answer
to such sentiments, turned back to the
piano and rattled off a brilliant fantasia,
which no one understood and every one
thought noisy.</p>

<p>It was the same with the games that Madame
Rosa proposed. For, when dancing
was forbidden, she thought she would enliven
her society by games. At first every one
refused to take part in them. They were
dull, childish, uninteresting, a waste of time;
but at last she gained over some of the
younger girls to a stray Cantab or two, whom
she had managed to get hold of somehow, no
one knew how. “She must have fished them
out of the lake,” said Miss Grandville; for,
indeed, Cantabs were rare animals in Langthwaite,
owing to the character for dullness
and cant which that beautiful vale had
gained in the university. A few used to
come, certainly: generally pale young men
wearing spectacles and afflicted with colds;
but Madame Floriani soon learnt to distinguish
the various types, and to fly this type as
she would poison. Yet even when she had
gone so far as to positively establish games
at her soirées, the Miss Grandvilles and the
Bentleyites used to sit by grimly, and protest
in loud whispers against the downward course
of things in Langthwaite.</p>

<p>Madame Floriani was almost disheartened.
Had it not been for that strange little bit of
principle in her, that she owed it to the
society of her place to do something pleasant
for it, she would have given up the attempt
of amusing it in despair. But it was a matter
of conscientiousness, and she did not like
to be defeated. Fortunately, just at the
moment when she was most dispirited, she
found that she had really made some way.
Her fascinating manners, her beauty, her
grace, her knowledge of the world, the
purity and innocence of her mind, her tact,
and her imperturbable good-humour, at
last had their weight. Added to which exterior
circumstances, that great want of the
human heart—that want of life, of pleasure, of
sensation, which no ascetic folly can destroy,
however it may distort—began to make
itself felt. The Miss Winters and many of the
younger girls ranged themselves on Madame
Floriani’s side. They helped her in her soirées;
they played at her games; they shared her picnics;
they shot at her archery meetings, nay,
they even danced to her waltzes; though Mr.
Bentley was so angry that he did not speak
to Miss Laura when he met her the next
day, because he said, as the eldest, she ought
to have known better, and was leading her
younger sisters to destruction. Which made
Laura cry, poor girl; but Helen called
their incumbent a detestable little fellow;
though she felt as if she had spoken blasphemy
when she said it. Altogether Langthwaite
was decidedly divided into two
parties, because of the waltzing that went
on at Madame Floriani’s Wednesday evenings.</p>

<p>No one could understand Mr. Bentley. He
was the bitterest enemy Madame Floriani
had; at least to judge by his conversation;
and, yet, if it were so, why did he go so constantly
to Whitefield House? and why, if he
disapproved so highly of her conduct, did he
still continue to attend her evening parties?
He never missed one, by any chance, though
the Miss Grandvilles and others were only
waiting for his lead to follow him to open
secession. And why did he turn pale when
he saw her coming down the lane, and
why did he turn red when he shook her
hand? Miss Augusta Grandville, the youngest—she
was thirty-four—who had been the
beauty of the family and gave herself still
the airs of a juvenile—Miss Augusta who
had always been his fast ally, his most indefatigable
district visitor, his head class
teacher, his unfailing satellite, who would
not have missed a missionary meeting nor a
bible class for all the world—Miss Augusta
was uneasy. She did not like these symptoms;
she did not like Mr. Bentley’s leniency
in still continuing to visit Madame
Rosa; her voice was for war, an open declared
right honest war, and she would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>the incumbent’s shield-bearer. So, she said
to him one day, after a peculiarly joyous
evening at Whitefield House; adding what
she thought an irresistible argument, or
rather inducement: “If you will give up
Madame Floriani, my sisters and I will
follow you.” At which Mr. Bentley stammered
and blushed; then sighed, and said
nasally, “We must still hope for her conversion.”</p>

<p>Apple-cheeked Mr. Bentley was unhappy.
He began even to look so: which was somewhat
difficult to that insignificant countenance
of his. But apple-cheeked Mr. Bentley
was in love. Disguise it as he might
to himself and to others, deny it, scorn and
reject it—it was none the less true—he was
in love with Madame Floriani. True, she
was a heathen; but then her natural graces
were so many! True, she was a woman of
the world, an artist, a lover of frivolity—but
then she was kind to the poor and so
gentle in her temper! True, she was all that
he most reprobated, all that he most abhorred;
but then he loved her. What should he
do? Marry her, and so lose his influence
over the world he had governed so long?
But should he lose his influence? The
Grandvilles would be angry; perhaps they
would leave Langthwaite—he wished they
might; but he could manage all the rest.
He should be rich too; very rich; and money
always gives power. Mr. Bentley had no
pious horror of that side of worldliness.
Yes, on the whole he should be better off;
even in Langthwaite. Yes, he would marry
her.</p>

<p>These were his reasonings spread out
over many days and weeks, during which
time he was much at Whitefield House, often
to Madame Rosa’s great inconvenience and
annoyance. And indeed of late she had
adopted the habit of denying herself; an
offence which took all Mr. Bentley’s love to
forgive. For it was a falsehood, he said;
and worse—forcing her servants to lie for
her. While Rosa only answered, “Mais,
Monsieur l’Abbé, it is a thing seen—it is
understood—everybody knows what it means
when one says that Madame is not at home,
or does not receive to-day.”</p>

<p>“In the world, that may be,” said Mr.
Bentley; “but we do not understand such
positions here.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur l’Abbé! are you not the same
here as any where else? What is there
so peculiarly virtuous in Langthwaite that
you must make laws for yourselves against
all the rest of the world, and condemn all
the rest of the world? You don’t seem to
think that there is any crime in pride and
hatred, and self-sufficiency, and all that—only
in happiness and gaiety of heart. It is monstrous!”
cried Rosa, excited.</p>

<p>“Madame Floriani, I beg of you one favour,
I have asked it before. Do not call me monsieur
l’abbé, I am not a Romish priest, but a
Protestant minister,” said Mr. Bentley,
gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, pardon!” cried Rosa, with a toss of
her graceful head, and making that pretty
little noise with her lips which you hear
every Italian make when perplexed or dissatisfied.
“Oh, pardon! It is so natural to
me to call men of your profession abbés
or curés, that I forget. I will try to remember.”</p>

<p>“At least there is one great difference between
us,” said Mr. Bentley, turning very
red.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the pretty
widow tranquilly.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you?” said the incumbent, in
a voice that was meant to be caressing.</p>

<p>“If you please,” answered Rosa, nestling
herself back in her easy chair, and putting up
her feet on a tabouret.</p>

<p>“I mean,” said Mr. Bentley, after a short
pause, and making a desperate rush, like a
cart-horse at a fence. “I mean, that we Protestant
clergy may marry, and the Romanist
priest cannot.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true; and I don’t like married
priests,” said Rosa quietly.</p>

<p>“Why, Madame Floriani?” asked the incumbent,
trembling.</p>

<p>“From association, I suppose. It is distasteful
to me.”</p>

<p>“Then you would not yourself?—” stammered
Mr. Bentley.</p>

<p>“What?” and Rosa lifted up her eyes in
astonishment at his voice.</p>

<p>“Marry a clergyman!” said Mr. Bentley,
with a kind of roar; and down he came on
his knees, first seizing her hand.</p>

<p>Madame Floriani slowly raised herself
from a reclining posture. She looked at
the young incumbent blushing and trembling
on the ground before her; and gently
drew away the hand he was holding between
his own. And his own were so red!
She was going to speak seriously; but—I am
grieved to say it of Rosa who ought to
have known better—the young man’s apple-face
and awkward attitude were so ludicrous—the
remembrance of all his absurd
attempts at solemnity and asceticism came
up so vividly in contrast with the ridicule
and humiliation of his present position—it
was such an unlooked-for offer, and was made
so clumsily, that her gravity gave way, and
she burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>It was very wrong, and there was no excuse
to be made for her; but the situation was
very ridiculous—though she should not have
laughed for all that. Mr. Bentley started up,
seized his hat and very tight umbrella—it
was a glorious day in July, but Mr. Bentley
patronised umbrellas—and rushed from the
house; turning round at the door to say,
angrily, “Your place shall know me no more,
madame!”</p>

<p>And so war was finally declared, and Miss
Augusta Grandville was satisfied. I doubt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>if she would have been as content if she had
known the full particulars of the casus belli.
Mr. Bentley said it was the hardened and
impenetrable nature of Madame Floriani—how
that he had sought to convert her, and
she had answered him only with mockery—and
Madame Floriani said nothing. She
only laughed; and drew a certain sketch,
which she showed to the Winter girls under
the strictest vows of secresy. Which, to
their honour be it said, they religiously kept.
Though, when Helen Winter met Mr. Bentley
the day after she had seen that drawing,
she turned so red in trying to look grave,
that Laura pinched her arm, and said,
“Helen! don’t be silly,” below her breath.</p>

<p>The Bentleyites were the strongest. In a
short time Madame Rosa’s Wednesday
evenings were almost deserted. All the very
good avoided her and her house as if a moral
plague existed around her. The Miss Grandvilles,
indeed, very nearly cut her. They
scarcely bowed when they saw her, and
passed her very stiffly even in church.
Sometimes they were afflicted with sudden
short-sightedness, and did not see her at all.
Miss Augusta, through being triumphant,
could afford to be magnanimous; and she
was a shade less distant in her manner:
when met with Mr. Bentley, she was positively
gracious. Then the Cantabs went
back to their respective colleges, and the
leaves began to fall. In the dreary autumn
weather—the rain and fog and drizzling mist—that
now came on, even her own adherents
could not come out so often to see her; so
that the sweet face grew sad in thinking of
the bright sky and the warm hearts of Italy;
and the joyous spirits sank in this social
solitude, for want of love and sympathy to
sustain it. The days were so grey and dark,
she could not even paint; and in the Langthwaite
lending library, were only dull histories
or biographies. The mud and the rain
frightened the soft half-foreigner, and kept
her much within doors, moping in a dull
Cumberland house, where the clouds came
down so low, that they sometimes rested on
the roof; and where the only visitors she saw
were half-a-dozen good-hearted country girls,
with not an idea amongst them beyond Berlin
work or babies’ caps; which, to a woman
accustomed to the best and most intellectual
society of Rome, was scarcely sufficient
mental distraction. What was she to do?—fight
or retire? She thought of Italy, of her
friends there, of the treasures of art, of
the beauty, the free life, the ease, the love,
the fulness of existence,—and she covered
her face in her hands, while tears forced
their way through her fingers. Then she
thought of Mr. Bentley, and of his offer
and of how he looked when he was down on
his knees before her; and she laughed till
she had a pain in her side. But she could
not laugh for ever at Mr. Bentley and his
offer, and the ennui of her life began to grow
insupportable. It was reported at last that
she was going away. It was Laura Winter
who said so first, by Rosa’s permission, one
day after she had been at Whitefield House.
Madame Floriani had cried, and said that she
was ill: the constant damp did not agree
with her; and she had grown very thin and
sallow rather than pale as she used to be;
and she said, too, that she was dull; she
could not bear it any longer. Her heart was
Italian. It would not live in such an atmosphere;
and then she had cried dreadfully, and
Laura had cried too, for sympathy. As girls
in the country always do.</p>

<p>So, Rosa owned herself beaten. Langthwaite
morality had been too strong for her,
and Langthwaite coldness too severe. Mr.
Bentley had won the battle, and she cared
now only for her retreat. She packed up her
pictures and her books, her statues and her
blue silk curtains; advertised Whitefield
House for sale; and sold it well too. A retired
sugar-broker bought it, and furnished it in
gold and velvet. He had not a picture, nor a
bust, nor a book; but he had hangings that
cost a small fortune, and an assortment of
colours that must surely please some one, as
none in the whole rainbow were absent.
Rosa had nothing to do with this; all she
cared for, was to get out of Langthwaite, and
to leave Cumberland clouds for Italian sunshine.
She went to make her farewell
calls. And, after having kissed all the Miss
Grandvilles on both cheeks—for she was a
generous, forgiving woman, with a loving
heart and a perfect temper, and would not
bear malice if she died for it—and after
having shaken hands cordially with Mr.
Bentley—who, like a foolish fat schoolboy,
attempted to sulk—she turned her sweet face
to the south, and left a climate that was
killing her, and a people who did not love
her, for the beauty and the graciousness of
Italy.</p>

<p>But she left the seeds of discord behind
her that soon bore deadly fruit. Deprived
of their patroness, the Florianites sank to
the ground. They were snubbed, maltreated,
slighted, and all but extinguished. And
when Miss Augusta Grandville at last got
Mr. Bentley to consent to their marriage, not
one of them was invited to the wedding. It
was the day of retribution, and the Bentley
faction were unsparing.</p>

<p>Madame Floriani did not forget her old
adherents when she was established in her
Roman home again; and after the Grandville
marriage had turned out notoriously ill—for
Miss Augusta was imperious, and Mr. Bentley
obstinate—she invited the two Winter girls
to Rome, and actually sent a man-servant all
the way down to Langthwaite to take care of
them on their journey. Which royal act
nearly canonised her, though Mrs. Bentley
said it was ridiculous, “And, good gracious!
could not those two girls take care
of themselves—if indeed they went at all,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>which if they had been her sisters they should
not have done?”</p>

<p>Madame Floriani was very kind to her old
friends. She took them everywhere, and
fêted and petted them beyond measure. Their
soft, pretty English faces, with their bright
cheeks and long fair ringlets, made a sensation
among the dark eyes and raven locks at
Rome. The Miss Winters were decidedly
the belles of their society—which is a
woman’s state of paradise. Madame Floriani
with her foreign notions set about marrying
her young ladies. A task not very difficult;
for foreigners like English wives; because
they can trust them so much; and English
women like foreign husbands, because they
are more polite than their own countrymen.
So Madame Rosa married them both—one
to a count and the other to a baron.
And when they went back to Langthwaite,
which they did for their wedding trip,
the people called them my lord and my
lady, and treated them like queens. Even
Mrs. Bentley yielded the past, which was
a marvellous distinction, and made up for a
great deal of the past. After all, then, Rosa
had not entirely lost; the days of her teaching
survived in her disciples, for Laura Winter
settled at Langthwaite, and remodelled society
there after the Floriani system. And now
that Mr. Bentley was married, of course his
influence was lessened; and all the young
ladies who had tried to touch his heart by
their austerity, now thought more of Laura’s
foreign friends who came to see her, and who
thought life without innocent laughter not
worth the living.</p>

<p class="ph3">OUR WICKED MIS-STATEMENTS.</p>

<p>We meant to say no more upon the
subject of the strike of Lancashire masters
against Factory law, until we had seen
the issue of a question raised before
one of the superior courts; but the publication,
by the National (or, as it should
read, Lancashire) Association, of a pamphlet
written by Miss Martineau, which attacks
our veracity, compels us to speak, or to hazard
misinterpretation of our silence. If no question
of public justice were involved, we should
prefer misinterpretation to the task of showing
weakness in a sick lady whom we esteem.
We have a respect for Miss Martineau, won
by many good works she has written and
many good deeds she has done, which nothing
that she now can say or do will destroy;
and we most heartily claim for her the respect
of our readers as a thing not to be
forfeited for a few hasty words, or for a scrap
or two of argument too readily adopted upon
partial showing.</p>

<p>The pamphlet in question is an essay
written, as we are told in an introduction,
for the Westminster Review, and declined on
account of its manner of treatment. When
we say that a part of its manner is to accuse
this journal of “unscrupulous statements,
insolence, arrogance, and cant,” and that
amidst much abuse of “Mr. Dickens or his
contributor”—“his partner in the disgrace,”
another part of its manner is to abuse Mr.
Dickens personally for “conceit, insolence,
and wilful one-sidedness,” it will be seen that
the editor of the Review exercised the discretion
of a gentleman. We regret very much
indeed that the National (or Lancashire) Association
has been less discreet, and, by issuing
the paper as a pamphlet at its own expense,
has been less friendly to the lady than the
lady wished to be to them. We are reluctantly
compelled to show, that both in tone and
argument Miss Martineau’s pamphlet, published
by the Lancashire Association to Prevent
the Fencing of Machinery, is—we will
not forget her claims upon our forbearance,
and we will say—a mistake.</p>

<p>And first, as to the tone. Using in her
reply the manner pointed out by us, Miss
Martineau says, that certain articles in
the eleventh volume of this journal<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> put forward
inaccurate statements, “in a temper
and by language which convey their own
condemnation.” But, lest it should be thought
that what was wrong in us cannot be quite
right in herself, Miss Martineau adds, on the
same page, “I like courtesy as well as anybody
can do; but when vicious legislation
and social oppression are upheld by men in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>high places, the vindication of principle, and
exposure of the mischief, must come before
consideration of private feeling.” Now, confessing
for a moment our defect of temper,
might we not say, very fairly, that a writer
who believes in his heart that resistance
to a given law dooms large numbers of
men to mutilation, and not few to horrible
deaths, may honestly speak with some indignation
of the resistance by which those
deaths are produced; and that the same
right to be angry is not equally possessed
by an advocate who argues that the deaths
cannot be helped, and that nobody has a
right to meddle specially in any way with a
mill-owner’s trade? But if any dispassionate
reader of the articles to which Miss Martineau
refers should pass from them to the
personal invective with which they are met,
he will not fail to perceive that we attacked
only what we held to be an evil course of
opposition to a necessary law, and abided
firmly by the leading features of the case,
apart from any personal consideration. We
spoke plainly, as the case required, and with
the earnest feeling that the case called forth;
but it will be found, on reference, that in not
one of these articles was an attack made
upon any person whomsoever; that the chairman
of the National Association was not
named; that when cases of accident were
necessarily cited, it was enough for us to say
“a certain mill,” because we spoke of principles
and not of persons. It will be found,
also, that we took pains to disconnect our
plain speaking upon one shortcoming; from
a general disparagement of mill-owners; and
that we went quite out of our way to occupy
no inconsiderable part of these papers with a
cordial reminder of the excellent enterprises
and fine spirit that belonged to chieftains
of the cotton class. Miss Martineau says for
herself, that “in a matter of political morality
so vital as this, there must be no compromise
and no mistake.” We felt so too; but also
felt that it would be a great mistake and a
great compromise of principle, to intrude
personalities on the discussion of it.</p>

<p>The history of the present pamphlet, given
by its author in a letter to the “Association
of Factory Occupiers,” is, that wishing to controvert
the views of Mr. Horner, the Factory
Inspector, she mentioned her desire to obtain
the facts on both sides of the question “to
a member of your Association, who visited
me soon after;” and we cannot help feeling,
that for the facts on both sides, which
are so clearly only the statements on one
side, and (we hope for her sake) for the
temper too, the writer is indebted to her
faith in the opinions of her friend. She
thinks also, that the notes of a barrister who
edited the Factory Act show “that it was high
time the passionate advocates of meddling
legislation should be met by opponents of
such legislation who are, by position, likely
to be at once dispassionate and disinterested.”
To ensure this desirable result, a pamphlet
written in a passion, is sent to be published
and circulated by the Association directly
engaged in maintaining one side of the matter,
and composed of the persons most distinctly
interested in its issue.</p>

<p>Vexed at the blindness of the barrister-at-law,
who is as blind as ourselves, Miss Martineau
goes on to say, in her prefatory letter,
“What can instigate any lawyer, who cannot
be supposed an interested party, to
write such a preface as Mr. Tapping’s, it
is difficult to imagine. On opening it, my
eye falls at once on a false statement,
which ought to destroy all the authority of
the rest.” What is the “false statement”
of Mr. Tapping? Mr. Tapping wrote that
the manufacturers have instituted the National
Association of Factory Occupiers, for
the special purpose of raising a fund for
defraying thereout all fines for not fencing,
which may be inflicted upon members....
“This statement,” adds Miss Martineau, “is
dated October second, eighteen hundred and
fifty-five; whereas the Special Report of
your Association, dated July, expressly declares
that the Association will pay no
penalties awarded under Factory Acts.”
Miss Martineau’s difficulty would have vanished
had she known the truth; which is
this:—It was announced distinctly, by the
founders of the Association, so long ago
as the March previous, that they <i>would</i>
raise money to pay penalties; and it was
only when they were made conscious of
the danger of the ground so taken, that
they forestalled the period of an annual
report, and printed the so-called Special
Report, in which they took pains to fence
themselves off against legal accident. This
report was their own stroke of policy, printed
for themselves, and to be had only from their
office. It was not advertised nor published;
it was sent to members—it was there to use.
As soon as it came into our hands, through a
private source, we made our comments on it;
but the date of its being written, though it
has July on the cover, is the seventh of
August. After it was written, it had to be
printed, and it could then only have been by
some unlikely chance that any tidings of it
could have reached a barrister in London by
the second of October. The public reports of
the proceedings connected with the formation
of the Association had informed him that
there was a proposition to pay penalties
incurred by occupiers who refused to fence.
There was no other source of information
open to him.</p>

<p>This point is of importance to us, and we for
the second time place it beyond question that,
before the appearance of the Special Report,
the Association did combine to pay penalties,
in obedience to the recommendation of a body
of mill-owners who had gone to London with
the hope of getting the Factory Act into discredit
with the government. The recommendation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>was read at the meeting<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> in these
distinct terms: “The deputation are of opinion,
that a fund of not less than five thousand
pounds should be immediately raised; and
they suggest that all cases of prosecution
which the committee of management are of
opinion can be legitimately dealt with by the
Association, shall be defended by, <i>and the
penalties or damages paid out of, the funds of
the Association</i>.” Whereupon it was moved,
seconded, and unanimously resolved:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That the recommendation in the report, to raise
immediately a sum of not less than £5,000 be immediately
carried into execution, and that an additional
contribution of one shilling per nominal horse-power
from each mill-occupier (making a total of two shillings)
be at once called for, to enable the committee to
carry out the recommendation to defend, <i>at the cost of
the Association</i>, all cases of prosecution which they
may consider fairly to come within the sphere of the
Association.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We have only to add, that the report including
these resolutions, besides receiving a
wide notoriety through the newspapers, was
printed and circulated by the Association
itself, and that a copy of it was obtained by us
before we wrote upon the subject. There can
be no doubt, then, under what impressions the
first members of the Association joined it, and
of the accusation under which it justly lay
until it thought best publicly to withdraw
from a dangerous position.</p>

<p>On this same point, Miss Martineau is of
opinion that “Mr. Dickens had better consider,
for the sake of his own peace of
mind, as well as the good of his neighbours,
how to qualify himself for his enterprise
before he takes up his next task of reform.
If he must give the first place to his
idealism and sensibilities, let him confine
himself to fiction; and if he will put himself
forward as a social reformer, let him do the
only honest thing,—study both sides of the
question he takes up. How far he is from
having done this in the present case, a short,
but not unimportant statement may show.
He says, by his own pen, or his contributor’s
[let us say, then, his contributor’s]
‘But the factory inspectors will proceed for
penalties? Certainly they will; and then, if
these gentlemen be members of the National
Association of Factory Occupiers, they will
have their case defended for them and their
fine immediately paid.’ Yet while the writer
declares his information to be drawn from
the papers of the Association, he ignores the
following conspicuous passages from their First
Report”—the retractation then being quoted.</p>

<p>Now, setting aside the likelihood or unlikelihood
of Mr. Dickens, to secure his peace
of mind, taking ghostly advice from Miss
Martineau, there is no doubt that in the said
First Report the retractation was conspicuous,
and that moreover, it was meant to be conspicuous;
but we can hardly think it so conspicuous
as to have been visible, not merely
before it <i>was</i> visible, but, as we firmly believe,
even before it was so much as conceived.
On the same line with the page 605 of
this journal, upon which we are lectured, are
inscribed the words “Household Words,
July 28, 1855.” The number dated on that
day was, in the usual manner, published three
days previously, and issued in Manchester on
the twenty-sixth of July, but the report which
we failed to do the honest thing by citing was
not written—as we find by the date against
the chairman’s signature—until the seventh of
August! When it reached us in September
we at once (in our two hundred and eighty-fifth
number) made public its purport; but we
did not say what we may now say, namely, that
there came with it a remark which we believe
to be true, and which dates certainly go far
to justify: that the Special Report—a thing not
contemplated in the rules—was actually suggested
by our comments,—that our journal,
containing a wide publication of the illegal
position of the recusant mill-owners, having
reached Manchester on the twenty-sixth of
July, was considered by the committee of the
Association to necessitate retreat to safer
ground by means of a Special Report, and that
by the seventh of August, the report was completed
and signed; after which, it has been
further suggested to us, that July was put upon
the cover, not without a hope that somebody
might be misled into believing that it had
really been produced several weeks sooner
than it was. Be that as it may, we should
not have supposed that the Association, for
the sake of passing a so easily detected deception
on the public, would have imperilled the
reputation of an honourable lady by leaving
uncorrected in her pamphlet a flagrant error,
of which it could by no conceivable chance
have been ignorant, and by suffering it to
go forth, headed in small capitals, <span class="smcap">Mis-statements
in Household Words</span>.</p>

<p>We turn with sorrow to the other contents
of the pamphlet. As the pamphlet of the
Association we are bound to show why it
can only damage the cause of the Association
with the government and with the public;
we would have wholly spared the writer our
present exposure of her mistake, if we could.</p>

<p>The pamphlet begins with some calm wise
words about the war, by which the reader is
prepared to expect a very different treatment
of the immediate topic in hand than that
which it is destined to receive. No sooner is
the subject touched than the false keynote is
struck, and of all persons in the world, it is
Miss Martineau whom we find echoing the
exaggerated lamentations of an injured interest.
“The issue,” we are told, “to which
the controversy is now brought, is that of the
supersession of either the textile manufactures,
or the existing factory law. The
two cannot longer co-exist.” This is one of
those remarkable predictions of which we are
beginning, by a very long national experience,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>to understand the value. If the cry be not
ridiculous enough in the form just quoted,
how does it look thus—for we have it repeated
afterwards in this more piquant way,—“It
seems to be agreed by the common
sense of all concerned who have any common
sense, that our manufactures must cease, or
the factory law, as expounded by Mr. Horner
must give way.” We believe it was Mr.
Bounderby who was always going to throw
his property into the Atlantic, and we have
heard of Miss Martineau’s clients being indignant
against Mr. Bounderby as a caricature.
And yet this looks very like him!</p>

<p>The pamphlet then adopts the precise
tone of the mill-owners in speaking of the
accidents as chiefly “of so slight a nature that
they would not be noticed anywhere but in a
special registration like that provided by the
Factory Act. For instance, seven hundred
are cases of cut fingers. Any worker who
rubs off a bit of skin from finger or thumb, or
sustains the slightest cut which interferes
with the spinning process for a single day,
has the injury registered under the act.” In
the next place the yearly deaths by preventable
accidents from machinery, which number
about forty, are reduced to eleven, by
excluding all machinery except the actual
shafts, and throughout the pamphlet afterwards
the number eleven, so obtained, is
used—once in a way that has astonished us, as
it will certainly surprise our readers. Even
lower down on the same page the writer slips
into the statement, that there are only twelve
deaths a-year by “mill-accidents from all
kinds of factory machinery.” We wish it
were so; but in the last report, published before
we made our comments, there were
twenty-one slain in six months; one hundred
and fifty had, in six months, lost parts of
their right hands; one hundred and thirty,
parts of their left hands; twenty-eight lost
arms or legs; two hundred and fifty had
bones broken; a hundred had suffered fracture
or serious damage to the head and face.</p>

<p>In the report for the half-year next
following, the deaths by machinery in factories
were eighteen; one hundred and sixty-one
lost the right hand, or, more generally,
parts of it; one hundred and eighteen the
left hand, or parts of it; two hundred and
twenty had bones broken. Thirty-nine,
therefore, was the number of deaths in the
year last reported (a fresh half-yearly report
is at present due), and there was no lack of
accidents more serious than the “rubbing off
a bit of skin.” Of the factory accidents, we
are also told, not five per cent. are owing to
machinery. If so, great indeed must be the
number of the whole! But it is solely of the
accidents arising from machinery that we
from the first have spoken, since upon
them only the law is founded which we wish
to see maintained.</p>

<p>So far as we can understand the figures of
the pamphlet, they arise from the ingenuity
of some friend, who has eliminated from
the rest those accidents arising out of
actual contact with a shaft, and then put this
part for the whole. But the law says, “That
every fly-wheel directly connected with the
steam-engine or water-wheel, or other mechanical
power, whether in the engine-house
or not, and every part of a steam-engine and
water-wheel, and every hoist or teagle, near
to which children or young persons are liable
to pass or be employed, and all parts of the
mill-gearing in a factory shall be securely
fenced.” The whole controversy is about
obedience to this law, and the consequences
of resistance to it. The most horrible and
fatal accidents are those connected most immediately
with the shafts; the unfenced shafts
are the essential type of the whole question,
and the fencing of them implies necessarily
the general consent to obey the law. For this
reason we have, no doubt, in common with
other people, frequently represented by such
a phrase as unfenced shafts, the whole fact of
resistance to the law, without any suspicion
of the ingenious turn that might be given to
the question on this ground, by an Association
not ashamed to employ sleight of hand in
argument.</p>

<p>And now that we discuss the figures of the
pamphlet, we turn to another of the strange
pages, headed Mis-statements in Household
Words. We make, it is said, the extraordinary
statement, that these deadly shafts “mangle
or murder, every year, two thousand human
creatures; and considering,” the writer
adds, “the magnitude of this exaggeration
(our readers will remember that the average
of deaths by factory shafts is twelve per
year) it is no wonder that he finds fault with
figures when used in reply to charges so
monstrous. When the manufacturers produce
facts in answer to romance,” we proceed,
it is said, “to beg the question as usual; in
this passage: ‘As for ourselves, we admit
freely, that it never did occur to us that it
was possible to justify, by arithmetic, a thing
unjustifiable by any code of morals, civilised
or savage.’”</p>

<p>By that admission we abide—and by our
figures we abide. This specimen of our mis-statements,
of our “begging the question as
usual,” is a yet more curious example of a question
begged by the accusers, than that other
proof of dishonesty which consisted in our not
having read a document several weeks before it
came into existence. We said, in the passage
above cited, that the deadly shafts “mangled
or murdered” so many persons a-year; that
by the machinery left unfenced in defiance of
the law, two thousand persons were mutilated
or killed. The writer of the pamphlet has been
led to beg wholly the addition of the mutilated
on our side, and to set against it, on her
side, only the killed, and not all those: only a
selection from them of the persons <i>actually
killed on shafts</i>; advantage being taken of
the use of the phrase, deadly shafts, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>represent machinery in unfenced mills. And
that it is really meant, in the writer’s own
phrase to “ignore” the fact that we counted the
killed, is evident from a succeeding sentence.
“If Mr. Dickens, or his contributor, assigns
his number of two thousand a-year, his opponents
may surely cite theirs—of three-and-a-half
per cent. or twelve in a-year.” Our
number, certainly, was wrong; but it erred
only by under-statement. We might have
said nearly four thousand, without falsehood.
The number of deaths and mutilations together
arising from machinery in factories, has been
two thousand, not in a year, but half a year.
Because we did not wish to urge the slight
cuts, and the few scarcely avoidable mishaps
which did not belong fairly to the case as we
were stating it, we struck off some two
thousand from the number that we might
have given.</p>

<p>Our readers may now form some estimate
of the strange weakness and unreasonableness
of the pamphlet, issued by the Factory Association
to refute us. There is not one strong
point in it that affects the question; there is
only one that seems strong, and to that the
writer had in her own hands a most conclusive
answer. Mr. Fairbairn, in December 1853,
reported against the practicability or safety of
fencing horizontal shafts. The answer to this
is repeatedly contained in the Inspector’s
reports for the half-year ending on the
thirtieth of April last, cited at the head of Miss
Martineau’s pamphlet. Their joint report
states, “that a considerable amount of horizontal
shafting under seven feet from the
floor has been securely cased over in various
parts of the country, and that strap-hooks and
other contrivances for the prevention of accidents
from horizontal shafts above seven feet
from the floor, have been and are now being
extensively employed in all our districts,
excepting in that of Lancashire, and in places
mainly influenced by that example.” And
Mr. Howell is to be found reporting that in
the west of England much new fencing had
been done, and that the experiment had
“been tried on a sufficiently large scale, and
for a sufficiently long period to prove the
fallacy of the apprehensions that were expressed,
as to the practicability and success
of fencing securely horizontal shafts. It has
proved also that the doing so is unaccompanied
by danger.” He gives illustration of this
from the west of England, adding, however,
that “in many instances, and more especially
in the cotton factories in that part
of my district which is situate in Cheshire
and on the borders of Lancashire, little or
nothing has yet been done, with some few
conspicuous and honourable exceptions, to
satisfy the requirements of the law in this
respect.”</p>

<p>The pamphlet adds the Manchester cry of
Fire! and quotes the agent of a fire-office, who
gave it as his opinion, that if mills had
boxed machinery they ought to pay increased
insurance, because “away they would go without
any possibility of salvation.” The agent
of a fire-office, as we all know, may be the
butcher, the baker, or the candlestick-maker,
sage or not sage; and to judge by his language
in this particular case, not sage. Now, however,
when a very large number of mills out
of Lancashire are habitually working fenced
machinery, will the National Association
be so candid as to tell us—not what some
local agent has said, but what the fire-offices
do?</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbairn’s authority against rectangular
hooks is quoted in the pamphlet. He
says they will increase the danger—would
pull all about the peoples’ ears. But do
they? In the last report which the writer
represents as having been consulted for the
other side of the question, the inspectors
jointly state that “in none of our districts has
any accident come to our knowledge from
the coiling of a strap round a horizontal
shaft where strap-hooks have been put up in
the manner recommended.” And Mr. Redgrave
reports thus from Yorkshire: “With
respect to one of the precautions which is
considered of great value in Yorkshire and
other parts of my district—I mean the strap-hook,
for preventing the lapping of the strap
upon the revolving shaft; the fact that
not an accident has been reported to me
during the last six months as having been
caused by the lapping of a strap upon
a shaft, nor by one of the many thousand
strap-hooks which have been fixed up in a
very large number of factories, more or less
in the different departments of fifteen hundred
out of two thousand factories which constitute
my district, in a large proportion of which,
moreover, they have existed for many years,
may be taken as conclusive evidence that the
strap-hook does obviate the lapping of the
strap, thereby preventing accidents, and does
not increase the danger of the shaft and its
liability to cause accidents.”</p>

<p>Our evidence does not end here, but we
must have regard to space. We pass rapidly
over the statements in the pamphlet that the
men who die, die by their own indiscretion,
or, as Miss Martineau expresses it, “climb up
to the death which is carefully removed out
of their natural reach.” This climbing up to
death will occur to any sane man or woman,
perhaps, as being excessively probable,
but it is not true; very few deaths are
the result of gross and active carelessness:
some arise from a momentary inadvertence;
but the reports of inquests constantly
sent to us show that at least half who
die, can in no fair sense be said to deserve
any blame. The pamphlet itself quotes
inadvertently the statement of an engineer,
that “there should be a ready means of putting
on the strap when the mill is in motion;”
doing this is a common cause of death.
Again, one man is seized by a loose end of his
neckcloth, another dragged to his death out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>of a cart, because a cloth in it is accidentally
blown by the wind against machinery.</p>

<p>Need we do more than allude to such
arguments as, that if law compels the
fencing of machinery (which while in motion
thus can seize the passive stander-by) it
ought to compel windows to be barred,
because people can throw themselves out
of them, and trees to be fenced, because
boys can climb up and tumble down? If we
take thought for the operative, working in the
midst of dangerous machinery, are we, it is
asked, to legislate “for every drunken vagabond
who lies down in the track—every deaf
old man who chooses the railway for his
walk?” Need we answer such preposterous
inquiries?</p>

<p>We have maintained that it is strictly within
the province of the law to protect life, and to
prohibit any arrangements by which it is
shown that the lives of people in pursuit of
their lawful and useful work, are without
necessity endangered. Preventable accidents
of every kind we have always declared it to
be the duty of the legislature to prevent. We
are told that Common Law suffices for all
cases. It is hardly worth while to spend time
in showing that it does not, and cannot provide
for these cases. Common Law is the law as
established for a given and considerable length
of time, and it arose out of the fusion of much
special legislation. It knew nothing of steam-engines,
and it is impossible that it should
have foreseen such cases as arise out of the
new systems of railway and factory. Common
Law will not make factories safe working
places for the operative; special consideration
must be given to the subject. When
we learn, as Sir John Kincaid reports from
Scotland, that a sufficient fencing of three
hundred and fifty feet of horizontal shafting
cost one factory only six pounds; that the
casing of two hundred and fifty-one feet of
shafting above seven feet from the floor—more
precaution than was absolutely needed—cost
another factory only eight pounds four;
that a Paisley factory cased three hundred
and twenty-four feet of such shafting most
efficiently with block iron casing, for no more
than sixteen pounds four, we refuse to
listen to the cry of Mills on Fire—Ruinous
Expense—Manufactures must cease—Fatal
Principles—Property going to be pitched into
the Atlantic—and simply wait until the recusant
Lancashire Mill-owners have done calling
names and litigating, and have learnt that
if they will not voluntarily take the necessary
steps to prevent the more horrible sort of
accidents in their mills, they must take them
by compulsion.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau suggests the impropriety
of any discussion until doubt has
been removed by the settlement of a point
raised before the Court of Queen’s Bench.
The whole matter is to remain in abeyance—things
are to go on as they are, and there are
to be no convictions—while the point mainly
at issue is awaiting the decision of the
higher courts. Let us see what this means.
The point at issue, as the pamphlet rightly
states, is the interpretation of the words
“securely fenced;” and it was agreed some
time ago that in the case of a certain prosecution
for unfenced machinery, the question
should go before the Queen’s Bench to determine
whether machinery could be said to
be otherwise than securely fenced when no
accident could be shown to have been
caused by it; whether the fact that such
machinery had led to deaths and mutilations
in other mills proved it, or did not
prove it, to be insecure in a mill where,
as yet, no blood had been shed. The question
so raised is an obvious quibble, and even
the known uncertainty of the law could
scarcely throw a doubt over the issue of a
reference to its supreme courts. Meanwhile
the issue was raised. The great purpose and
business of the Association seemed to be to
raise it. One, at least, of the inspectors stood
aside from the disputed class of prosecutions
till the doubt so raised should be definitively
settled. We ourselves now fall under reproof
for not solemnly and silently awaiting the
decision of the question, whether securely
fenced means so fenced as that an accident
shall not have happened, or so fenced that an
accident shall not arise. We now learn upon
inquiry, that while we have been waiting,
and the Association has been claiming a
twice-pending judicial decision, we find—what
do our readers suppose?—that no
case whatever awaits the opinion of the
Judges!</p>

<p>We believe that we have now answered all
the accusations laid against ourselves in Miss
Martineau’s pamphlet. There is one citation of
“actual resolutions of the Association,” side
by side with our summary of their purport,
presented as a “conviction of the humanity-monger,”
of which we need say nothing,
because it cannot fail to suggest to any person
only moderately prejudiced, that our summary
is very close and accurate indeed.</p>

<p>We will pursue the pamphlet no further,
having set ourselves right. There is not
an argument, or statement, or allusion in
it that is not open to rebuke. It fails
even in such small details as when a professor
of Literature with a becoming sense of
its uses, and that Professor the authoress of
Forest and Game Law Tales, and of many
volumes of Stories on Political Economy, should
gracefully and becomingly think it as against
Mr. Dickens, “pity, as a matter of taste, that a
writer of fiction should choose topics in which
political philosophy and morality were involved.”
It fails when accusing us of “burlesque”
and “irony,” because we put plain things
“in the palpable way which a just-minded writer
would scrupulously avoid,” and have, God
knows, with a heart how full of earnestness,
tried to make the suffering perceived that must
have been involved in all these accidents. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>fails even when against this “philo-operative
cant,” its writer must needs quote Sydney
Smith. “We miss Sydney Smith, it is said, in
times like these—in every time when a contagious
folly, and especially a folly of cant and selfish
sensibility, is in question. This very case,
in a former phase came under his eye”—and
then we have two notes of what he said against
the Ten Hours’ Bill: sayings with which, it
happens, that the writer of these papers perfectly
agrees. When a case really parallel
to this, affecting, not the laws of labour, but
the carrying on of trade in a way leading
sometimes to cruel deaths came under his
eye, we did not miss Sydney Smith indeed!
The author of the paper upon climbing boys
was the last person for Miss Martineau to
quote. “We come now,” begins one of his
paragraphs, “to burning little chimney-sweepers;”
and the same paragraph ends by
asking, “What is a toasted child, compared
to the agonies of the mistress of the house
with a deranged dinner?” Palpably put, and
with a bitter irony, we fear!</p>

<p>We have done. We hope we have not
been induced to exceed the bounds of temperate
and moderate remonstrance, or to prostitute
our part in Literature to Old Bailey
pleading and passionate scolding. We
thoroughly forgive Miss Martineau for having
strayed into such unworthy paths under the
guidance of her anonymous friend, and we
blot her pamphlet out of our remembrance.</p>


<p class="ph3">COMING SOUTH A CENTURY AGO.</p>

<p>Many amusing books (and many dull ones)
come into existence through the clubs which
have been following the fashion of the Bannatyne
in Edinburgh, the Maitland in Glasgow,
and the Camden and Grainger in
England. The northern clubs have indulged
the most in what the French call luxurious
editions. They have benefited by
the notion that each subscriber will, in
addition to his very moderate subscription,
sooner or later print a book for them at his
own charge. And when a duke presents to
one of these societies the Chartulary of
Melrose at the cost of a thousand guineas,
and an earl having paid as much for the
printing of the Chartulary of Paisley goes on
to produce four or five quartos of the Analecta
of Woodrow, the example of liberality
is set upon no trifling scale. As gifts, though
not to be refused, are not always well chosen,
volumes that are scarcely worth the pains of
reading do occasionally appear. This by the
way. We have been reading without any sense
of pain one of the publications of the Maitland
club—a piece of history relating to a family at
present extinct in the male line, the Stewarts
of Coltness, in Lanarkshire. Authorship ran
in their blood. One of their family wrote a
domestic narrative in the year sixteen hundred,
which was the main source of a genealogical
history of the race drawn up by a
Sir Archibald one hundred and seventy-three
years later. There were cavalier Coltnesses,
and there was a Gospel Coltness; but
the Coltness to whom we mean to pay attention
in this place is a lady—a literary Coltness,
married unto Mr. Calderwood of Polton, in
Mid-Lothian. This clever dame descended
into England, exactly one hundred years ago,
and passed over Holland, on a journey to her
brother, a political exile at Aix-la-Chapelle.
She wrote a journal, and regarding England
through a Scotch mist of her own, took notes
in a shrewd way; sometimes canny, and sometimes
(as regards the relative merits of the
north and south), of a not wholly unquestionable
kind. This lady had been bred up in
the family of a distinguished crown lawyer;
was accustomed to the best society in Scotland;
was in her own family commander-in-chief
over an amiable husband; and, if we
may venture to state so much, forty years of
age, when she, for the first time in her life,
came south.</p>

<p>Mrs. Calderwood and her husband travelled
from Edinburgh to London in their own post-chaise,
attended by a serving-man on horseback
with pistols in his holsters and a broadsword
in his belt. There was a case of
pistols in the carriage, more fit, perhaps, for
the use of the lady than of the good-natured
laird; who, being a man of accomplishments,
took with him a pocket Horace to beguile the
hours of wayfaring. They set out on the
third of June; and, being on the road each
day for twelve or fourteen hours, arrived in
London on the evening of the tenth.</p>

<p>On the road of course, one day, the lady
dined at Durham, “and I went,” she adds,
“to see the cathedral; it is a prodigious
bulky building.” The day happening to be
Sunday, Mrs. Calderwood was much shocked
at the behaviour of little boys, who played at
ball in what she termed the piazzas, and supposed
that the woman who was showing her
the place considered her a heathen,—“in particular
she stared when I asked what the
things were they kneeled upon, as they
appeared to me to be so many Cheshire
cheeses.” Mrs. Calderwood had travelled
far into England before she met with any
sensible inhabitant; and then the first intelligent
native is recorded, and proves to have
been a chamber-maid.</p>

<p>“At Barnet we stopped; and while we
changed horses, I asked some questions at the
maid who stood at the door, which she
answered and went in. In a little time out
comes a squinting, smart-like, black girl, and
spoke to me, as I thought, in Irish; upon
which I said, ‘Are you a Highlander?’
‘No,’ said she, ‘I am Welch. Are not you
Welch?’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘but I am Scots, and
the Scots and Welch are near relations, and
much better born than the English.’ She
took me by the hand, and looked so kindly,
that I suppose she thought me her relation
because I was not English; which makes me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>think the English are a people one may
perhaps esteem or admire, but they do not
draw the affections of strangers, neither in
their country nor out of it.”</p>

<p>The general appearance of the southern
country is thus pleasantly</p>

<p>“The villages to north of Trent are but
indifferent, and the churches very thin sown;
and, indeed, for a long time one would think
the country of no religion at all, there being
hardly either Christian church or heathen
temple to be seen. The fields on both hands
were mostly grass; and the greatest variety
and plenty of fine cattle, all of various
colours. I admired the cattle much more
than the people; for they seem to have the
least of what we call smartness of any folks I
ever saw, and totally void of all sort of
curiosity—which, perhaps, some may think a
good quality.... As for the inclosing in
England, it is of all the different methods,
both good and bad, that can be imagined;
and that such insufficient inclosures, as some
are, keep in the cattle (which is so hard with
us in Scotland) is entirely owing to the levelness
of the grounds; so that an English cow
does not see another spot than where she
feeds, and has as little intelligence as the
people.” Surely the cows are to be pitied,
born incapable of taking comprehensive views
of things in this flat and unprofitable land.
If ever there arose a chance of wider views
for the fair traveller, England rose not in her
esteem on that account. “Sometimes,” she
owns, “we had an extensive prospect, but not
the least variety, so that we could say there
was too much of it. No water, no distinction
between a gentleman’s seat and his tenant’s
house, but that he was a little more smothered
up with trees.” The lady, when she reached
London, found the same reason for contempt
of Hyde Park as a place of resort; it was
naught, because it was quite smothered with
trees. She also surprised the crowded
Londoners that she thought England on the
whole less populous than Scotland, and there
is a good deal of right observation in the
sketch she gives of England extra-metropolitan
a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>“In the first place, look from the road on
each hand, and you see very few houses;
towns there are, but at the distance of eight
or ten miles. Then, who is it that lives in
them? There are no manufactories carried
on in them; they live by the travellers and
the country about; that is, there are tradesmen
of all kinds, perhaps two or three of
each—smiths, wrights, shoemakers, &amp;c.; and
here is a squire of a small estate in the
country near by; and here are Mrs. This, or
That, old maids, and so many widow ladies
with a parsonage house, a flourishing house.
All the houses, built of brick, and very
slight, and even some of timber, and two
stories high, make them have a greater appearance
than there is reality for; for I shall
suppose you took out the squire and set him
in his country house, and the old maids and
widow ladies and place them with their relations,
if they have any, in the country, or in
a greater town, and take a stone house with
a thatch roof of one storey instead of a brick
one of two, and there are few country villages
in Scotland where I will not muster out as
many inhabitants as are in any of these post
towns. Then I observed there were few
folks to be met with on the road, and many
times we could post an hour, which is seven
miles, and not see as many houses and people
put together on the road! Then on Sunday,
we travelled from eight o’clock till we came
to Newcastle, where the church was just
going in; so that I may say we travelled
fifteen miles to Newcastle; and the few
people we met going to church upon the road
surprised me much. The same as we went
all day long; it had no appearance of the
swarms of people we always see in Scotland
going about on Sunday, even far from any
considerable town. Then,” adds the Scotch
lady, “the high price of labour is an evidence
of the scarcity of people. I went into what
we call a cottage, and there was a young
woman with her child, sitting; it was very
clean, and laid with coarse flags on the
floor, but built with timber stoops, and what
we call cat and clay walls. She took me
into what she called her parlour, for the
magnificent names they give things makes
very fine till we see them; this parlour was
just like to the other. I asked her what her
husband was. She said, a labouring man,
and got his shilling a day; that she did nothing
but took care of her children, and now
and then wrought a little plain work. So I
found that, except it was in the manufacturing
counties, the women do nothing; and if
there were as many men in the country as
one might suppose there would be, a man
could be got for less wages than a shilling
per day. Then the high wages at London
shows the country cannot provide it with
servants. It drains the country, and none
return again who ever goes as chairmen,
porters, hackney coachmen, or footmen; if
they come to old age, seldom spend it in the
country, but often in an almshouse, and often
leave no posterity. Then the export they
make of their victual is a presumption they
have not inhabitants to consume it in the
country, for, by the common calculation, there
are seven millions and one half in England,
and the ground in the kingdom is twenty-eight
millions of acres, which is four acres to
each person. Take into this the immense
quantity of horses which are kept for no real
use all over the kingdom, and it will be
found, I think, that England could maintain
many more people than are in it. Besides,
let every nation pick out its own native subjects
who are but in the first generation, the
Irish, the Scots, the French, &amp;c., and I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>afraid the native English would appear much
fewer than they imagine. On the other hand,
Scotland must appear to be more populous
for its extent and produce; first, by its bearing
as many evacuations in proportion, both
to the plantations, the fleet, and army, besides
the numbers who go to England, and,
indeed, breeding inhabitants to every country
under the sun; and if, instead of following
the wrong policy of supplying their deficiency
of grain by importing it, they would cultivate
their waste lands, it would do more than
maintain all its inhabitants in plenty.” The
lady presently becomes severe: “I do not
think the soil near London is naturally rich,
and neither the corns nor grass are extraordinary.
I thought their crops of hay all
very light, and but of an indifferent quality;
they call it meadow hay, but we could call it
tending pretty nearly to bog hay.”</p>

<p>Her admiration of things English seems
indeed to have been confined pretty closely to
its immense number of fine horses. “As for
London, the first sight of it did not strike me
with anything grand or magnificent....
Many authors and correspondents take up
much time and pains to little purpose on
descriptions. I never could understand anybody’s
descriptions, and I suppose nobody
will understand mine; so will only say London
is a very large and extensive city. But
I had time to see very little of it, and every
street is so like another that, seeing part, you
may easily suppose the whole.”</p>

<p>Then for the heads of London, your ill-meaning,
politician lords, the lady Samson
pulls their temple down over their heads.
“You will think it very odd that I was a
fortnight in London, and saw none of the
royal family; but I got no clothes made till
the day before I left, though I gave them to
the making the day after I came. I cannot
say my curiosity was great. I found, as I
approached the court and the grandees, they
sunk so miserably, and came so far short of
the ideas I had conceived, that I was loth to
lose the grand ideas I had of kings, princes,
ministers of state, senators, &amp;c., which, I
suppose, I had gathered from romance in my
youth. We used to laugh at the English for
being so soon afraid when there was any
danger in state affairs; but now I do excuse
them. For we, at a distance, think the
wisdom of our governors will prevent all
those things; but those who know and see
our ministers every day, see there is no
wisdom in them, and that they are a parcel
of old, ignorant, senseless bodies, who mind
nothing but eating and drinking, and rolling
about in their carriages in Hyde Park, and
know no more of the country, or the situation
of it, nor of the numbers, strength, and
circumstances of it, than they never had
been in it. And how should they, when
London and twenty miles round it is the
extent ever they saw of it?”</p>

<p>There were here some remarks not very
inappropriate, considering that they were
written when the Duke of Newcastle was
fighting on his stumps, and the ferment concerning
Admiral Byng was at its height.</p>

<p>There seems to have been some connection
between the Calderwoods and Mr. George
Stone Scott, sub-preceptor to the Prince of
Wales, afterwards George the Third. Mrs.
Calderwood says—“I had frequent opportunities
of seeing George Scott, and asked him
many questions about the Prince of Wales.
He says he is a lad of very good principles,
good-natured, extremely honest, has no heroic
strain, but loves peace, and has no turn for
extravagance; modest, and has no tendency
to vice, and has as yet very virtuous principles;
has the greatest temptations to gallant
with the ladies, who lay themselves out
in the most shameful manner to draw him
in, but to no purpose. He says, if he were
not what he is they would not mind him.
Prince Edward is of a more amorous complexion;
but no court is paid to him, because
he has so little chance to be king.” Mrs. C.!
Mrs. C.! how sweet a dish of scandal! We
will next meet with her setting out in gracious
humour, and will not be startled should
a ripple come over the current of her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Any of the English folks I got acquainted
with I liked very well. They seemed to be
good-natured and humane; but still there is
a sort of ignorance about them with regard
to the rest of the world, and their conversation
runs in a very narrow channel. They
speak with a great relish of their public
places, and say, with a sort of flutter, that
they shall go to Vauxhall and Ranelagh, but
do not seem to enjoy it when there. As for
Vauxhall and Ranelagh, I wrote my opinion
of them before. The first I think but a
vulgar sort of entertainment, and could not
think myself in genteel company whiles I
heard a man calling ‘Take care of your
watches and pockets!’ I saw the Countess
of Coventry at Ranelagh. I think she is a
pert, stinking-like hussy, going about with
her face up to the sky, that she might see
from under her hat, which she had pulled
quite over nose, that nobody might see her
face. She was in deshabille, and very shabby
drest, but was painted over her very jawbones.
I saw only three English peers, and
I think you could not make a tolerable <i>one</i>
out of them.... I saw very few, either men
or women, tolerably handsome.”</p>

<p>But her woman’s heart could not resist the
men in regimentals; she was determined, too,
to have a good look at them, as her journal
tells.</p>

<p>“I went one morning to the park, in hopes
to see the Duke review a troop of the Horse
Guards, but he was not there; but the Guards
were very pretty. Sall Blackwood and Miss
Buller were with me; they were afraid to
push near for the crowd, but I was resolved
to get forward, so pushed in. They were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>very surly, and one of them asked me where
I would be,—would I have my toes trod off?
‘Is your toes trode off?’ said I. ‘No,’ said
he. ‘Then give me your place, and I’ll take
care of my toes.’ ‘But they are going to fire,’
said he. ‘Then it’s time for you to march
off,’ said I, ‘for I can stand fire. I wish your
troops may do as well.’ On which he sneaked
off, and gave me his place.”</p>

<p>A few other sketches we give for the sake
of their succinctness. Greenwich Hospital
“is a ridiculous fine thing.” The view from
the hill, there, “is very pretty, which you
see just as well in a raree-show glass. No
wonder the English are transported with a
place they can see about them in.”</p>

<p>We give also as a curiosity, because we
wonder how the lady ventured to present to
us,—King George the Second in his bedroom
at Kensington.</p>

<p>“There are a small bed with silk curtains,
two satin quilts, and no blanket; a hair mattress;
a plain wicker basket stands on a
table, with a silk night-gown and night-cap in
it; a candle with an extinguisher; some
billets of wood on each side of the fire. He
goes to bed alone, rises, lights his fire, and
tends it himself, and nobody knows when he
rises, which is very early, and he is up several
hours before he calls anybody. He dines in
a small room adjoining, in which there is
nothing but very common things. He sometimes,
they say, sups with his daughters and
their company, and is very merry, and sings
French songs; but at present he is in low
spirits.”</p>

<p>Finally, let us show how Mrs. Calderwood
brings her acutely haggis-loving mind to bear
upon the English ignorance of what is good
for dinner.</p>

<p>“As for their victuals, they make such a
work about, I cannot enter into the tastes of
them, or rather, I think they have no taste to
enter into. The meat is juicy enough, but
has so little taste that if you shut your eyes,
you will not know, by either taste or smell,
what you are eating. The lamb and veal
look as if they had been blanched in water.
The smell of dinner will never intimate that
it is on the table. No such effluvia as beef
and cabbage was ever found in London!
The fish, I think, have the same fault.”</p>

<p>At the want of a sufficiently high smell to
the fish eaten by the English, we are very
well content to stop, and stop accordingly.</p>


<p class="ph3">THE ROVING ENGLISHMAN.</p>

<p class="ph4">THE SHOW OFFICER.</p>

<p>We go stumbling along the unpaved streets
of Galatz by the dim light of a lantern carried
before us by a servant. The town, although
the chief commercial city of the Danubian
Principalities, and numbering its inhabitants
by tens of thousands, is of course unlighted.
The outward civilisation of these countries
showy as it appears, has unhappily gone no
further, up to the present time, than jewellery
and patent-leather boots. Light, air, and
cleanliness are at least two generations
a-head of it.</p>

<p>Our hotel, the best in the town, is not better
than a Spanish inn on the Moorish frontier.
The doors do not shut, the windows do
not open. There is a bed, but it is
an enemy rather than a friend to repose.
The bed-clothes are of a dark smoke-colour,
stained in many places with iron-moulds,
and burned into little black holes
by the ashes of defunct cigars. The bed,
bedstead, and bed-clothes are alive with vermin.
They crawl down the damp mouldy
walls, and swarm on the filthy floor, untouched
by the broom of a single housemaid
since its planks were laid down. Battalions
move in little dark specks over the
pillow-case; they creep in and out of the
rents and folds of the abominable blanket.
On a crazy wooden chair—of which one of
the legs is broken—stands a small red pipkin,
with a glass of dingy water in the
centre. A smoky rag, torn and unhemmed,
is laid awry beside it. They are designed for
the purposes of ablution.</p>

<p>The walls of the room are very thin; and
there is a farewell supper of ladies and gentlemen
going on in the next room. I saw the
guests mustering as we came in. They were
so ringed and chained that they would
have excited envy and admiration even at a
Jewish wedding. They are all talking together
at the top of their voices against
the Austrian occupation. The odour of their
hot meats and the fine smoke of their cigarettes,
come creeping through the many
chinks and crannies of the slender partition
which divides us. Twice I have heard a scuffling
behind my door, and I have felt that an
inquisitive eye was applied to a key-hole,
from which the lock has long since been
wrenched in some midnight freak. Derisive
whispering, followed by loud laughter, has
also given me the agreeable assurance that
my movements are watched with a lively
and speculative interest. They appear to add
considerably to the entertainment of the
company. I am abashed by feeling myself
the cause of so much hilarity, and stealthily
put out the light. Then I wrap myself up
resolutely in a roquelaure, take the bed by
assault, and shut my eyes desperately to the
consequences; doing drowsy battle with the
foe, as I feel them crawling from time to time
beneath a moustache or under an eyelid. I
am ignominiously routed, however, at last,
and rise from that loathsome bed blistered
and fevered. The screaming and shouting in
the next room has by this time grown demoniacal.
My friends are evidently making a
night of it: so I begin to wonder whether
the talisman of a ducat will not induce a
waiter and a lantern to go with me to the
steam-boat. I may pace the deck till morning,
if I cannot sleep; for the Galatz hotel-keepers
have I know protested against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>passengers being allowed berths on board the
vessels when in port.</p>

<p>The silver spell succeeds. A sooty little
fellow, like a chimney-sweep, agrees to accompany
me, and we go scuffling among rat-holes,
open sewers, sleeping vagabonds, and
scampering cats down to the quagmire
by the water-side; and scrambling over bales
of goods, and a confused labyrinth of chains
and cordage, gain the deck of the good ship
Ferdinand. A cigar, a joke, and a dollar,
overcomes the steward’s scruples about a
berth, and I wake next morning to the rattling
sound of the paddle-wheels.</p>

<p>The boat is very full. It is as difficult to
get at the washhand-basins as to fight one’s
way to the belle of a ball-room. I pounce
on one at last, however, by an adroit flank
movement, and prepare for a thoroughly
British souse, when a young Wallachian—in
full dress, and diamond ear-rings; who has
just been putting an amazing quantity of
unguents on his hair—comes up and coolly
commences cleaning his teeth beside me. He
looks round with a bright good-natured
smile when he has finished, and is plainly at
a loss to understand the melancholy astonishment
depicted in my countenance.</p>

<p>The deck is crowded with a strange company.
There are the carousing party who
broke my rest last night. They glitter from
head to foot with baubles and gewgaws;
but the gentlemen are unwashed and unshorn,
and it is well for the ladies that their
rich silk and velvet dresses do not easily
show the ravages of time and smoke. They
are dressed in the last fashions of Holborn
or the Palais Royal, and one of the dames, I
learn, is a princess, with more ducats and
peasants than she can count. She spends a
great part of the day adorning herself in her
cabin—the centre of an admiring crowd of
tinselled gallants, who assist at her toilette,
with compliments and with suggestions of a
naïveté quite surprising.</p>

<p>Then there is a fat old Moldavian lady of
the old school. She wears a black great-coat
lined with a pale fur, and Wellington
boots. Her head is swathed and bound up in
many bandages. She wears thumb rings, and
smokes continually. Our passengers are indeed
of the most motley character, for we have
quitted the excellent boats of the Danube
Company, and are now on board a vessel
belonging to the Austrian Lloyd’s, very inferior
in size and accommodation, although
built for going to sea. The first and second
class passengers mingle together indiscriminately,
and the whole deck is encumbered
with a shouting, screaming, laughing, wrangling
mass of parti-coloured humanity. There
are Gallician Jew girls, going under the
escort of some rascally old speculator to
Constantinople, and dressed like our poor
mountebank lasses, who go about on stilts
at country fairs. They are a bright-eyed
kindly race of gipsies and good-natured termagants,
with a smile and a saucy word
for everybody. Watching them, with great
contempt, is a German professor, who has
indiscreetly shaved the small hairs from the
point of his nose till he has quite a beard
on it. There is a long Austrian officer in a
short cavalry cloak, who looks not unlike a
stork; and there is a small Austrian officer,
in a long infantry great-coat, who domineers
over him, and is evidently his superior. They
are an odd pair, and pace the deck together
with a military dignity and precision quite
comical. There is a brace of gipsies, hereditary
serfs, with dark fiery eyes, rich complexions,
and red handkerchiefs tied picturesquely
with the striking grace in costume,
which distinguished that outcast race in all
countries. Then there are Greek and Armenian
traders engaged in all sorts of rascally
speculations connected with the war and
the corn markets—sly, sharp-nosed men who
have scraped together large fortunes by inconceivable
dodges and scoundrel tricks; who
have their correspondents and branch-houses
at Marseilles, Trieste, Vienna, Paris, London,
and New York; who would overreach a Jew
of Petticoat Lane, and snap their fingers at
him; who have all the rank vices and keen
wit of a race oppressed for centuries, newly-emancipated.
All power, wealth, and dominion
in the Levant is passing into their
hands. Long after I who write these lines
shall sketch and scribble no more, the chivalry
of the West will have a fearful struggle
with them. May Heaven make it victorious!
Our party is completed by two bandy beggars,
with grey beards and bald heads; a crowd of
the common-place men of the Levant, loud,
important, patronising, presuming, vile, ignorant,
worthless, astounding for their impudence;
the captain, a brusque, talkative, self-confident
Italian, and his wife, a lady from
Ragusa, silent and watchful, with a sweet
smile and a meaning eye.</p>

<p>We get under weigh betimes in the
morning; for, below Galatz, ships are only
allowed to navigate the Danube between
daylight and dark, so that in these shortening
days they must make the most of it.
The noble river is crowded with vessels;
and, now and then we meet a valuable raft of
timber for ships’ masts floating downwards.
This will be stopped by the Russians, to the
cruel injury of trade. I learn from an Armenian
merchant on board, that a mast such as
would sell for fifty pounds at Constantinople
may be here bought for five pounds or less;
so that there will be some grand speculations
in timber whenever peace is declared.</p>

<p>At Tschedal, just below Ismail, we come to
anchor; and, after a short delay, a trim
little boat shoots smartly out from the Bessarabian
shore towards us. It is pulled by
six rowers, in the peculiar grey great-coats
and black leather cross-belts which distinguish
Russian soldiers. At the helm is a
seventh soldier decorated with a brass badge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>and some medal of merit; at the prow stands
an eighth; in the seat of honour sits the
officer empowered to examine our passports,
and to ascertain that our ship carries no
military stores or contraband of war. At the
bottom of the boat is a pile of muskets, and
from the stern flutters the Russian war flag—a
blue cross on a white ground.</p>

<p>The trim little boat is soon hooked on to
our side, and the officer steps lightly and
gracefully on deck. He is a Pole; and, though
but twenty-five or twenty-six years old, is
already a major of marines. I cannot help
thinking also that he is a show-officer. He
is dressed within an inch of his life. His
uniform would turn half the heads at Almack’s;
for it is really charming in its elegant
propriety and good taste. It is a dark rifle-green
uniform, with plain round gilt buttons,
and not made tawdry by embroidery. Two
heavy epaulettes of bullion, with glittering
silver stars, which announce the rank of the
wearer, are its only ornament. His boots
might have been drawn through a ring, and
look quite like kid gloves on his dainty little
feet. His well-shaped helmet is of varnished
leather, with the Russian eagle in copper gilt
upon it; and this eagle and the bright hilt of
his sword flash back the rays of the sun
quite dazzlingly. We, poor dingy, travel-stained
passengers appear like slaves in the
presence of a king before him.</p>

<p>He speaks French perfectly. He is excruciatingly
polite, and is evidently a man of the
world, conscious of being entrusted with a
delicate duty; but rather overdoing it. He
would be handsome, but for small cunning,
or rather roguish eyes, when roguish is used
in an undefined sense, and may mean smartness
good or bad; but it is difficult to take his
measure. He has evidently seen service.
His hair is of the light rusty brown of nature
and exposure. His face is shorn, except a
sweeping moustache peculiarly well trimmed.
There are some lines about his face which
tell the old story of suffering and privation.</p>

<p>He is, as I have said, courteous—more than
courteous. He does not even examine the
Greek and Moldo-Wallachian passports; but
he pauses over the French and English to
see if the visas are correct. Mine he examined
more narrowly, and then returned it with a gay
débonnaire bow, a polite smile, and a backward
step. A Greek keeps up a conversation with him
the whole time he remains on board. I fancy
there is more in it than meets the ear. In
speaking to this fellow the major takes a short,
sharp, abrupt, hasty tone of command, like
a man in authority pressed for time. The
major does not examine the hold of the vessel,
nor interrogate any of the Austrian officers.
There is evidently a shyness and ill-will
between them.</p>

<p>When we have each filed past him in turn,
the Pole draws his elegant figure up to its
full slim height, tightens his belt, and marches
with a light gallant step from one end of the
vessel to the other. Then he halts at the
gangway, faces about, casts a hawk’s eye
round the ship, and descends the companion-ladder.
The trim little bark is hooked closer
on; then the grapnels are loosened, and she
spreads her light sail to the wind. The rowers
shelve their oars, and the next moment she
is dashing the spray from her bows, and flying
towards the shore with the speed of a
sea-gull. At the stern sits the Pole upright
as a dart, the sunbeams toying with his helmet—a
picture to muse on.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been in better taste
than the whole thing. It might have served
for a scene of an opera, or a chapter in a
delightfully romantic peace novel. I confess
I cannot help feeling something like a pitying
tenderness for the smart cavalier; who
may, a few days hence, be called away to the
war, and return to his true love never—be
mashed by a cannon shot, or blown into
small pieces by a mine—his life’s errand all
unaccomplished, his bright life suddenly
marred. I think, too, how strange and sad
is the destiny which can make such a Pole
take part in a cause which, if successful, will
rivet the chains of his countrymen for ever;
and how he would meet his patriot countrymen
who have joined the hostile ranks in
hundreds for only one faint hope of freedom.</p>

<p>Below Ismail the Danube was a perfect
forest of masts, and we had some difficulty in
steering our way through the maze of ships.
The river is very narrow in many places. A
child could easily throw a stone across it.
The Turkish and Russian labourers in the fields
on the Bulgarian and Bessarabian shores
are within hail of each other. And every
breeze blows waifs and strays across the narrow
boundary. Turkish and Russian wild-fowl,
wiser than men, chat amicably together
about their prospects for the winter, and call
blithely to each other from shore to shore
among the reeds. The character of the
country on both sides of the river is very
much the same—flat and uninteresting. Now
and then, however, a charming little valley
opens among woods and waters in the distance,
and here and there rises a solitary
guard-house, or a few fishermen burrow
among rocks and caverns. Thirty hours
after our departure from Galatz we steam
into the crowded port of Sulina, where one
thousand sail are wind-bound.</p>
